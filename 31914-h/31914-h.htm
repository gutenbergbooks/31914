<h2>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> writer gratefully acknowledges the aid
he has received in the preparation of this book.
To President Greene and Mr. J. E. Bell of William
Jewell College, Missouri, he is under
special obligations. Mr. Bell in order to aid
the writer spent several days in Linn County,
Missouri, verifying and obtaining facts. To
Mr. Herbert Putnam of the Library of Congress,
Mr. John Cotton Dana of the Newark,
New Jersey, Public Library, and to Dr. Arthur
E. Bostwick of the St. Louis Public Library he
owes a special debt of gratitude for bibliographies
and carefully prepared suggestions as
to sources of information. From Cashin's
"Under Fire with the 10th U. S. Cavalry,"
Missouri State Historical Review, Reports of
the War Department and other publications,
selections and citations have been made and
from the facts contained in dispatches from
France, particularly the very excellent reports<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>
in the New York <i>Times</i> and New York <i>Sun</i>,
the writer has obtained valuable information.
The direct aid of United States Senator Frelinghuysen
in obtaining data from the War
Department and the suggestion of United
States Senator Warren have been most helpful.
Replies to questions sent to friends and
relatives of the General have assisted in verifying
certain facts and figures. Many who personally
knew the great commander in his
younger days have very kindly given the writer
such help as lay within their power. He gladly
recognizes his indebtedness, especially to the
following persons: Mr. Charles Spurgeon,
Brookfield, Mo.; Judge O. F. Libby, Bigger,
Mo.; H. C. Lomax, Esq., Laclede, Mo.; S. E.
Carothers, Waco, Tex.; Mr. Robert S. Huse,
Elizabeth, N. J., whose father was the "splendid
old Caleb" of the Highland Military
Academy; Hon. E. W. Stephens, Columbia, Mo.;
Mrs. Louisa D. Warren, Meadville, Mo., and Mr.
Wesley L. Love, Brookfield, Mo. Major James
E. Runcie, Librarian of the United States Military
Academy, West Point, N. Y., and General<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
P. C. Harris, acting the Adjutant General, have
both been exceedingly kind in providing and
verifying certain items of information which
otherwise it would have been difficult if not
impossible to obtain. The writer wishes to
thank all these good people who have helped
to make even the gathering of data an inspiration.
Articles appearing in many current magazines
and newspapers have provided interesting
items, but the writer has quoted from them
only after verification of certain details.</p>

<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> purpose of the writer of this little book
is merely to tell the story in outline of the
career of the commander of the American Expeditionary
Forces in France. The modesty of
General Pershing has kept his name out of print
to a greater extent than in the case of many
of our prominent men. His advancement also
came rapidly in these recent years. As a result
of these two conditions many of the fellow
countrymen of the General are not familiar
with the story of his early life or his successful
work in the Philippines. This they not only
have a right to know, but they ought to know.</p>

<p>The writer has endeavored to tell the story
briefly as it has been told him, or as it has been
kept in the records of the War Department and
elsewhere. The complete biography and the
analysis of General Pershing's personality and
military career he leaves to later writers. The
simple story of the struggles and achievements
of a more or less typically successful American
is presented, with the hope that others also may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
find in the record the inspiration and interest
which the writer has found. Sometimes fighting
against obstacles that appeared almost insurmountable,
struggling to obtain an education
in the schools, not faltering when tragic
sorrows came, his determination succeeding
in military campaigns where previous centuries
of fighting had failed&mdash;the career of General
Pershing has been a continuous overcoming.
Confidence in a great leader is an essential condition
of victory and the writer has tried to
present facts to show that the trust of the
American people in their military leader is well
founded.</p>

<p>Some years ago a certain tight-fisted denizen
of the United States inquired sneeringly of a
young man from his village, who was working
his way through college, "What do you expect
to make of yourself anyway?" Instantly came
the reply, "A man." Cause and effect, aim and
incentive, object and motive alike are all
slimmed up in that response. Behind the General
is the man whose story the writer has tried
to tell just as he has found it.</p>

<h2>THE STORY OF GENERAL PERSHING</h2>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Historic Moment</span></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> morning of June 13, 1917, was one of the
historic mornings in the history of the world.
On the landing dock at Boulogne, France, a detachment
of French infantry was drawn up in
line. The men were clad in the uniform of
battle. Their faces confirmed the report that
recently they had seen hard service in the
trenches&mdash;as they had. Not a young soldier
was in the lines&mdash;they were all middle-aged
men, perhaps made older by the fearful experiences
through which they recently had passed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
This morning, however, there was an air of
eagerness and expectancy in the expressions on
their faces; and the eyes of all, with an intentness
that was at once pathetic and tragic, were
watching a boat that was drawing near the
landing stage.</p>

<p>In the assembly on the dock an observer
would have seen certain of the great men of
France. There were Brigadier General Pelletier;
Ren&eacute; Bernard, Under Secretary of State
for War; General Dumas; General Dupon, representing
General Petain; and the military governor
of Boulogne. Representatives of other
nations and forces also were in the midst of
the eager throng. There, too, were Sir George
Fowke, representing General Sir Douglas
Haig; and Captain Boyd, Military Attach&eacute; of
the American War Department. Men, resplendent
in their uniforms and decorations, who
represented the British and French navies, also
were in the assembly, all as deeply interested
as were their military comrades. The nearby
streets were filled with people waiting and subdued,
and yet in a state of mind that at any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
moment would have carried the great assembly
into the wildest enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The cause of the excitement was to be
found in a little group of men assembled on
the deck of a steamer that was slowly approaching
the dock. In the center of the group
stood a man in the uniform of the United States
Army. He was six feet in height, broad shouldered,
trim-waisted, muscular and wiry. His
hair was gray and his closely cropped mustache
was also tinged with gray. His dark eyes were
glowing, though every nerve and muscle was
under the control of his will&mdash;a will that was
as strong as his prominent chin and nose indicated.
It was the first time in the history of
the world that an American soldier was landing
in Europe, there to fight for his own country
and for the liberty of the world. There is slight
cause for wonder that a murmur ran from one
to another in the expectant crowd: "Truly
here comes a man!" And the man was to be
followed by millions, clad in the uniform of the
land from which he came.</p>

<p>We may be sure that when this soldier, General<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
John Joseph Pershing, stepped ashore and
General Dumas greeted the American in the
words, "I salute the United States of America,
which has now become united to the United
States of Europe," there was a cause for the
deep emotion that manifested itself in Pershing's
dark eyes. It was, as he said, "a historic
moment." As he greeted the French
colors, the detachment of brave men that had
recently come from the firing line stood immovable
like men of steel, and the American general
slowly passed down the line, his face alone
still betraying his feeling over the deep solemnity
of the moment. And what a moment
it was! Their dead had not died in vain, their
heroic struggle against barbarism, all the sorrows
and losses the devoted French people had
borne were now focused on the coming of an
American general and his staff. For behind
him was America, and she was coming too.</p>

<p>And this American general, with his staff of
fifty-three officers and one hundred and forty-six
men, including privates and civilian <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'attaches'">attach&eacute;s</ins> ,
stood before the beholders as the fore-runners<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
of a mighty host which was determined
to help clear the world of the German
menace to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
General Pershing, the fifth full general
of the United States, is the successor to
Washington, Grant, Sherman and Sheridan.
So modest has been his career, so great his reluctance
to appear in print, that many, even
in his own nation, are not familiar with the
deeds he has done. He has not sought promotion,
but promotion sought him. Apparently,
at times, in far away provinces, he has
been banished to obscurity. Seven years passed
before he was raised from the rank of a second
lieutenant to a first lieutenancy, and yet the
year 1917 found him in command of the American
Expeditionary Forces in France, the first
leader of American troops to land with drawn
swords on the soil of Europe. The record is
marvelous and it is also inspiring. What manner
of man is this commander? What is the
story of his life? Who were his father and
mother? Where did he come from? How did
he develop the powers that led one American<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
President to advance him eight hundred and
sixty-two points at one time and caused another
President to select him as the one man to command
the soldiers of the United States in
France? What are his qualifications&mdash;mental,
moral and physical?</p>

<p>This story is an attempt to answer these
questions in such a manner that the people of
his own land may be able to understand a part
at least of the career of the man behind the
general. It does not try to analyze critically
the military career of General John Joseph Pershing,
nor does it primarily portray the development
of the soldier. It is rather a modest
recital of the leading events in the life of Pershing,
the man, who became Pershing, the
General.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Birth and Early Home</span></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">From</span> this, the time of our greatest war, we
must drop back approximately half a century to
the time of our second greatest war. It is noteworthy
that General Pershing, our leader in the
war for the world's freedom, was born in the
early days in the war for the negroes' freedom.</p>

<p>The future general first saw the light September
13, 1860, in or near the little village of Laclede,
Missouri. The lad was "from Missouri"
and the current semi-slang expression has certainly
been true in his case. One had to "show
him," for he made up his mind, mapped out his
own plans and conducted his own studies and
investigations. This characteristic has remained
with him to this day. The accepted date
of his birth and the house in which he was born
are still matters of mild dispute among the good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
people of the little village of Laclede. A friend
of his boyhood days says, "He was born in a
section house about 3,000 yards from the site
of the old depot. The foundation is still there."
But the people of Laclede and Meadville, a
nearby hamlet, are not a unit in this detail,
though all are heartily agreed and proud in
their recollection of the lad who since has made
the little hamlet famous.</p>

<p>"Grandma" Warren (Mrs. Louisa D.)
through her daughter sends the following contribution
to this mooted question:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"My mother states that in the spring of 1859, the
General's father and mother, then recently married,
came to board with her father, Meredith Brown, who
resided about two and one-half miles east of Meadville,
Mo. My mother, then a widow, was living at
the home of her father and was associated with the
Pershings that summer.</p>

<p>"In the fall of the year the Pershings moved to
a house of their own about a half mile west of the
Brown home and this is the place where the General
was born. The tract of land on which the house stood
is now owned by John Templeman and is the north
&frac12; of Sec. 5, T'wp 57, range 21, Linn Co., Mo. The
house in which the General was born was destroyed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
by fire during the Civil War. Mother was present
at the General's birth and dressed him in his first
suit.</p>

<p>"From the house where the General was born they
moved to what was known as the 'Section House,'&mdash;a
house built for the section foreman of the railroad.
This house was located about two miles west of Meadville
on the Hannibal and St. Joseph R. R., now the
Burlington.</p>

<p>"During the time from 1859 and a few years later,
the senior Pershing was section foreman on this road.
At the last mentioned place of residence the second
child was born.</p>

<p>"After a few years' residence at the section house,
the family moved to Laclede, Mo., seven miles east of
Meadville. At this place the father engaged in mercantile
business, continuing in the business for a number
of years. My mother visited at the Pershing home
at this place frequently. After leaving Laclede,
mother lost communication with them.</p>

<p>"The citizens of Meadville and vicinity have in the
course of construction at the present time a large sign
to be erected at the birthplace of the General. My
mother is now in her 85th year.</p>

<p>"The place of the General's birth is near a small
stream known as Hickory Branch and the community
along this stream is known as the Hickory Branch
Community. In closing, I wish to pay my respects to
the General: John J. Pershing, the baby, belongs to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>

<p>It is not strange if seven cities contended
with one another for the honor of being the
birthplace of Homer that two small villages in
Missouri are divided in their claims for a similar
honor in the case of the present foremost
American soldier. As to the merits of the contest
it is impossible to pronounce judgment at
this time. The General himself has only hearsay
evidence of the exact locality of his birth,
though there is no question as to its having
taken place in Linn County, Missouri, and that
his boyhood was passed in the village of Laclede.</p>

<p>The General's father, John P. Pershing, a
short time before the birth of his oldest child
(the general), came from Westmoreland
County, Pennsylvania, and went to work as a
section foreman on the Hannibal and St. Joe
Railroad. He was a forceful man, of energy
and ambition, and it was not long before he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
was running a general store and at the same
time was postmaster of the village. A man
now living, who worked for the General's
father in both the general store and post office,
has this tribute to pay to his one time employer:
"He was a very active business man
with wonderful energy, strictly honest, never
stooped to a dishonest trick; a pronounced man
in the community; the leading business man.
He liked to make money. He lost two fortunes
on the Board of Trade, Chicago. He traveled
several years out of St. Joseph, probably one
of the best paid men. He later left St. Joe for
Chicago, where he was traveling salesman for
another firm. He made many business ventures&mdash;was
something of what to-day is called a promoter.</p>

<p>"He was a man of commanding presence.
He was a great family man, loved his family
devotedly. He was not lax and ruled his household
well."</p>

<p>The older Pershing was insistent that his
children should be able to meet the difficulties
in life that must be overcome before success<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
can be won. The value of regular habits of appreciation
of the things worth while, was his
hobby and he taught by example as well as by
precept. Hard work was essential. Therefore
hard work must be undertaken and done, and he
began early to train his three boys and three
girls, who of the nine that were born to him
grew to maturity. His creed included the precept
that it is well to learn to bear the yoke in
one's youth. Every Sunday the Pershing family
were seen on their way to the little Methodist
church of which the father and mother were
members, Mr. Pershing at one time being superintendent
of the Sunday School. He is reported
also to have been a local preacher. He was one
of the founders of his church.</p>

<p>A neighbor writes, "When the Civil War
broke out, the elder Pershing left the railroad
and became the regimental sutler of the old
18th Mo. Reg. Infantry. Later he engaged
in merchandising and farming with success,
but was caught in the panic of 1873. About
1876, he went to work for I. Weil &amp; Company<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
of St. Joseph, Mo., as a traveling salesman,
selling clothing, and later for a big Chicago
house. The family lived at Laclede until about
1886, at which time they moved to Lincoln, Nebraska,
where two of the daughters now reside.
General Pershing's father and mother are both
dead.</p>

<p>"The Pershing family were zealous church
people. John F. Pershing was the Sunday
School superintendent of the Methodist Church
all the years he lived here, I think, or until he
commenced to work for I. Weil &amp; Co. Every
Sunday you could see him making his way to
church with John (the general) on one side and
Jim on the other, Mrs. Pershing and the little
girls following along. The family was a serious
loss to the Methodist church when they moved
away from here."</p>

<p>Throughout his life there was an air of seriousness
under which the future general was
brought up. Doubtless from his earliest days
the impression that if he was to do anything
worth while he must first be something worth
while, consciously or unconsciously influenced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the life of the son of the father, who was eager
to have his children secure the best education
within their power to obtain and his ability to
give. At all events, the General's life-plan
seems to have been to get ready, whether or not
the test comes. If it does come, one is prepared;
if it does not come one is prepared just the
same. Here again it was the man behind the
general, shaped, guided, trained and inspired
by the strong, earnest personality of his father.</p>

<p>From a member of the Pershing family the
following statement has been received: "His
(the general's) father was born near Pittsburgh,
Pa., his ancestors having come from
Alsace-Lorraine. He was prominent in church
work and all philanthropic work. He established
the Methodist Church at Laclede, Mo.,
and after moving to Chicago was instrumental
in forming the Hyde Park Methodist Church.
He was also active in the Y. M. C. A., Chicago,
and organized the Hyde Park branch. He was
in the Union Army and was the first man to observe
Memorial Day in Laclede, taking his own
children and the children of his neighborhood,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
with flowers from his own garden, to decorate
the graves of the soldiers. Mr. Pershing (John
Fletcher Pershing) was president of the school
board at Laclede and it was through his work
that the graded schools were organized and
new buildings erected. He was also postmaster
in Laclede."</p>

<p>Of his mother&mdash;the best report from Laclede
is that she was a "splendid home maker."
Why is it that most great men have had great
mothers? Frequently we are disappointed in
the sons of great men. Either the boys do not
measure up to their sires, or we are prone to
expect too much of them, or, as is quite likely,
we contrast the young man at the beginning of
his career with the reputation of his father
when it is at its zenith.</p>

<p>But history is filled with examples of men
who have attributed all they have done or won
to the inspiring love and devotion of the
mothers that bore them. And General Pershing
is no exception to this rule. One time, when,
after years of absence he came back to Laclede
as a brigadier general in the army of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
United States, he went to call upon Aunt Susan
Hewett, an aged widow and old resident of the
town. In his boyhood, Aunt Susan and her
husband, "Captain" Hewett, had "run the
hotel." Aunt Susan in her prime was famous
for her pies and her love of boys, and Johnnie
Pershing was a favorite. As a result of her
affection for the lad he was a frequent and
successful sampler of her wares. The picture
of Aunt Susan and her pies and the sampling
done by the future general of the United States
Army is one that is easily imagined and
strongly appeals to those who know the worth
of well made pies,&mdash;for in spite of local pride,
good pies are not all limited to New England.</p>

<p>To a reporter two or three years ago Aunt
Susan said,<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> "Law, yes, I remember John when
he wasn't more'n two or three years old. When
John was big enough to put on trousers he used
to eat more pies in our kitchen than any other
boy in town.</p>


<p>"He was back here about ten years ago. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
was on the 24th day of October that Uncle
Henry Lomax came to my house and said, 'Aunt
Susan, there's a gentleman outside that wants
to see you.' When I stepped outside and saw
a tall young man, Uncle Henry asked me if I
knew who it was.</p>

<p>"'Yes,' I said, 'it's John Pershing. I can
see his mother's features in his face.' He came
to me with his arms open and he embraced me
and kissed me and we both cried. 'Aunt
Susan,' he says, and I'll never forget his words
as long as I live, 'it does my heart good to see
my mother's dear old friends. The place seems
like home to me and it always will. I've been
away a long time and there have been many
changes, but this is home.' The chrysanthemums
were in bloom and after we had talked
a while in the parlor I went out and picked a
bouquet for him to take away.</p>

<p>"'They are going to have some kind of a reception
for me to-night and I want you to come,
Aunt Susan,' he says. I told him I'd try to be
there but that I was tired and worn out because
I had been working hard in the garden. 'You<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
won't have to walk, Aunt Susan, because I'll
come after you myself.' About five in the afternoon
he came in a buggy. We went to his reception
together and my! what a crowd. The
whole house was packed and people were standing
in the yard. Johnny shook hands with
everybody and talked to them and he finally
made a speech, which I didn't hear because
there were so many people around. John Pershing
always did have talent."</p>

<p>This incident of his later years is eloquent
of the earlier years&mdash;and of Pershing's mother.
Behind the figure of the living is another who
being dead, yet speaketh. "A splendid home
maker."</p>

<p>The relatives of General Pershing disclaim
all knowledge of this incident and are inclined
to pronounce it "mostly fiction." The incident
is taken from the <i>Missouri Historical Review</i>.
In other forms also the story has become current.
A former friend of the family, now a resident
of Laclede, also questions the reliability of
the tale, basing his conclusion upon the fact
that the local village taverns were not places<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
which such a man as General Pershing's father
would knowingly permit his boys to frequent.</p>

<p>Nor is Aunt Susan's fact (or fiction) the only
tribute. Before me is a letter from a long time
friend and neighbor of the family which states:
"Mrs. Pershing stood high among her neighbors.
She was a woman of unusual intelligence
and much better educated than the average
woman of those days. She was an unusually
cultivated woman. Mr. Pershing probably had
the best library in the town. His father and
mother were both religious and John went to
Sunday School and church every Sunday." The
deep affection is apparent as one reads between
the lines of many letters received from those
who years ago knew her both personally and
well. It is not difficult to trace the source of
the inspiration of Pershing's life.</p>

<p>An intimate friend of the General in response
to a personal request has courteously given the
following modest statement: "General Pershing's
mother was Ann Elizabeth Thompson.
She was born near Nashville, Tenn. Although
she came of a southern family she joined her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
husband in her sympathy for the cause of the
North, and made the first flag that was raised
in Linn County, thereby risking the lives of her
family. One of her brothers was in the Southern
army, and one served on the Northern side.
When her brother, Colonel L. A. Thompson,
was wounded, her husband secured permission
to cross the line and brought him home. Mrs.
Pershing was always an inspiration for her
children and her ambition for them, especially
in an educational way, was without bounds."</p>

<p>And there came a time when General Pershing
doubtless realized as never before all that
his mother had been to him. His troops were
mounted and he was about to give the command
for the departure of his men on an expedition
against the Moros. At that moment an orderly
advanced and gave him a message which informed
him of the death of his mother, in her
far away home. It was a blow as hard as it was
sudden. The face of the leader was almost
ghastly in its whiteness. He swallowed hard
two or three times and then quietly gave the
command for his troops to advance. He was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
a soldier of his country and the message which
had brought him the deepest sorrow of his life
up to that time must not be permitted to allow
his personal grief to interfere with his duty.
The lesson his mother had taught him was put
to the test and was not forgotten.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Boyhood and Student Days</span></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the family were three boys and three girls
(of the nine children) that lived to manhood
and womanhood. Ward, the general's younger
brother, an officer in the Spanish-American
war, is dead. Lieutenant Paddock married the
General's sister, Grace. He died in China during
the Boxer uprising. Two other sisters now
reside in Lincoln and a brother is in business in
Chicago.</p>

<span class="caption">General Pershing as a Boy</span>
</div>

<p>The writer quoted above also says, "John
was always settled as a boy. There was nothing
sensational or spectacular about him. He
had the confidence of everybody." Another of
his boyhood chums writes: "John Pershing was
a clean, straight, well behaved young fellow.
He never was permitted to loaf around on the
streets. Nobody jumped on him and he didn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
jump on anybody. He attended strictly to his
own business. He had his lessons when he went
to class. He was not a big talker. He said a
lot in a few words, and didn't try to cut any
swell. He was a hard student. He was not
brilliant, but firm, solid and would hang on to
the very last. We used to study our lessons
together evenings. About nine-thirty or ten
o'clock, I'd say:</p>

<p>"'John, how are you coming?'</p>

<p>"'Pretty stubborn.'</p>

<p>"'Better go to bed, hadn't we?'</p>

<p>"'No, Charley, I'm going to work this
out.'"</p>

<p>One, who distinctly recalls him as a boy, describes
him: "His hair was light and curly.
He had large black eyes; was square-jawed
and was iron-willed. His shoulders were square,
and he was straight as an arrow. He had a
firm, set mouth and a high forehead, and even
as a boy was a dignified chap. And yet he was
thoroughly democratic in his manner and
belief."</p>

<p>Another, who was a playmate, has the following<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
tribute: "As a boy Pershing was not
unlike thousands of other boys of his age,
enjoying the same pleasures and games as his
other boyhood companions. He knew the best
places to shoot squirrels or quail, knew where
to find the hazel or hickory nuts. He knew,
too, where the coolest and deepest swimming
pools in the Locust, Muddy or Turkey creeks
were. Many a time we went swimming together
in Pratt's pond. At school John was
studious and better able than the most of us
to grasp the principles outlined in the text
books. As a rule he led his classes, particularly
in mathematics. His primary education was
obtained in a little white school house of one
room, eighteen by twenty feet, which is still
standing. Later he attended Lewis Hall, a
building which formerly was a hospital in the
War of the Rebellion. It was located across
the street from the Pershing residence. This
building later was moved to the old Pershing
farm (now owned by Mrs. John Deninger's
family) and is used as a barn.</p>

<p>"John was and is naturally human and that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
is why he always had so many friends. His old
playmates and friends are all proud of his success
as a soldier, but they love him because of
his high standards of principles and his unswerving
integrity. As a boy he was forceful,
honest in every way and when he had given his
word we all knew we could depend upon it
absolutely."</p>

<p>This boyhood friend acknowledges modestly
that he and John were not entirely ignorant of
the sensations produced by certain hickory or
osage switches in the hands of an irate or hasty
teacher, but this chapter is not enlarged. There
is, however, an unconsciously proud and tender
touch in his closing words, "I have two sons
in the army doing their bit, and I am thankful
that they will be under the direction and order
of my old friend, John J. Pershing." True
praise could not be better expressed than in this
gracious and kindly reference.</p>

<p>But the future general's boyhood was not all,
nor even chiefly devoted to swimming and nutting.
There was hard work to be done and he
was a hard worker. Long rows of corn had to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
be planted and cultivated, pigs and cattle must
be fed and cared for, and the "chores" on a
Missouri farm began early in the morning and
were not all done when at last the sun set. The
boy Pershing did much of his labor on the
farms that his father had leased near the village.
Frequently the farm-work lasted until
late in the fall and thereby interfered with attendance
at school. Here, too, there were obstacles
to be overcome and the commander of
our army in France was early learning his lessons
of control and self-control in a little hamlet
in Missouri.</p>

<p>At that time Laclede and vicinity had more
negroes than whites in its population. When
Pershing had arrived at the mature age of
seventeen, the teacher of a local negro school
suddenly left and the school was turned over
to him. There were three elements in the
"call" to this untried position&mdash;the school had
no other teacher, the need was great and in
spite of his youthfulness it was believed there
was no one who could do better under the circumstances
for the colored children than he.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
He understood them, he wanted to help them,
and he was able to control them. And he did.
"Discipline," as it was commonly understood
in the country schools, might have been defined
as the ability to whip the older boys. Discipline
as a positive as well as a negative force
was something new, and the new teacher
finished the year with the reputation of having
trained his pupils to do something worth while.</p>

<p>Then white schools were taken by the youthful
pedagogue, and in them also he succeeded.
There was growing up in his mind a strong
determination to secure an education. In this
way he was earning and saving money by which
he should be able to carry out his growing
plans. Dimly in the background also was an
ambition ultimately to study law. In this desire
not only his father and mother but also
his sister now was sharing.</p>



<p>In the <i>Missouri Historical Record</i>, April-July,
1917, there is recorded the story of a contest
into which the young teacher was forced
by an irate farmer whose children had been
disciplined.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>"Though he never sought a quarrel, young
Pershing was known even at this time among
his fellows as a 'game fighter,' who never
acknowledged defeat. To a reporter for the
<i>Kansas City Star</i>, who was a pupil under Pershing
when the general was a country school
teacher at Prairie Mound, thirty-seven years
ago, was recently related an incident of him as
a fighting young schoolmaster. One day at the
noon hour a big farmer with red sideburns rode
up to the schoolhouse with a revolver in his
hand. Pershing had whipped one of the farmer's
children and the enraged parent intended
to give the young schoolmaster a flogging.</p>

<p>"I remember how he rode up cursing before
all the children in the schoolyard and how
another boy and I ran down a gully because
we were afraid. We peeked over the edge,
though, and heard Pershing tell the farmer to
put up his gun, get down off his horse and fight
like a man.</p>

<p>"The farmer got down and John stripped off
his coat. He was only a boy of seventeen or
eighteen and slender, but he thrashed the old<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
farmer soundly. And I have hated red sideburns
ever since."</p>

<p>Through all these various experiences he was
saving every penny possible, with the thought
in view of the education he was determined to
obtain. At last the time arrived when he and his
sister departed for Kirksville, Mo., to enter the
State Normal School. His father had done all
in his power for him, but his main reliance now
was upon himself. There he continued his former
steady methodical methods, doing well, but
not being looked upon as an exceptionally brilliant
student. He was still the same persistent,
reliable, hard-working, successful student he
had formerly been.</p>

<p>It is not quite clear just when his decision
for West Point was made. His room-mate at
the State Normal School reports that it was in
the spring when he and Pershing were at home
in vacation time that the matter was decided.
According to his recollection and report to the
writer, when the two boys were at home the
elder Pershing urged his son's room-mate again
to enter his store as clerk. A definite answer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
was postponed until the following day. "So
next day I saw Pershing," he writes, "and
asked him what he was going to do. He didn't
know; he didn't want to teach a spring term
of school; believed he would go back to Kirksville
for ten weeks. And then came the West
Point opportunity."</p>

<p>Another friend of Pershing at that time sends
the following quotation from the local paper
which evidently places the date at another
time: "In looking over some old papers the
other day, I ran across a copy of the <i>Laclede
News</i> under date of December 28th, 1881, and
among other news items found the following:
'John J. Pershing will take his leave of home
and friends this week for West Point, where
he will enter the United States Military Academy.
John will make a first-rate good-looking
cadet with Uncle Sam's blue, and we trust he
will ever wear it with honor to himself and the
old flag which floats above him. John, here's
our hand! May success crown your efforts and
long life be yours.'"</p>

<p>In reality, however, the only confusion is between<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the time when the thought entered Pershing's
mind and the time when he entered the
Military Academy.</p>

<p>An advertisement had appeared in the local
papers concerning a competitive examination
for entrance. The announcement bore the name
of Congressman J. H. Barrows, the "greenback"
representative of the district, formerly
a Baptist minister. He was looked upon by his
constituency as true and reliable, a reputation
that was not without its appeal to the lads who
wanted to go to West Point. It is a current
report that not always had these appointments
been made on merit alone and that "from $250
to $500 was the amount frequently paid to obtain
them." The examination was to be conducted
at Trenton, Mo., and was open to all
who were eligible.</p>

<p>Pershing decided to try. In making this decision
his sister strongly encouraged him, and
was the only one of his family who was aware
of his plan. His room-mate writes that Pershing
urged him also to try. "No," I told him,
"I didn't know that I could pass." "Well,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
he said, "you'd better come and we'll take a
chance. One or the other of us ought to win."
I told him he had been in school three months
while I had been selling goods, and that if he
thought he would like it, to go, that I didn't
care for it. But I should like to have the education,
though I should probably stay in the
army if I happened to pass. "No," he said,
"I wouldn't stay in the army. There won't be
a gun fired in the world for a hundred years.
If there isn't, I'll study law, I guess, but I
want an education and now I see how I can
get it."</p>

<p>Eighteen took the examination and Pershing
won, though by only a single point, and that
was given only after he and his competitor,
Higginbottom, had broken the tie by each <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'diagraming'">diagramming</ins>
the following sentence&mdash;"<i>I love to
run!</i>"</p>

<p>Higginbottom's solution&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"I"&mdash;subject.<br />
"love"&mdash;predicate.<br />
"to run"&mdash;infinitive phrase qualifying the<br />
meaning of the verb.<br />
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>Pershing's solution was as follows:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"I"&mdash;subject.<br />
"love"&mdash;predicate,<br />
"to run"&mdash;is the object.<br />
</div>

<p>The commission preferred Pershing's diagram,
and thus by a single point he won the
competitive examination and received the appointment.</p>

<p>When, however, Pershing and his sister informed
their mother that he had passed the
best examination and was to receive the appointment
to West Point, she expressed her
strong disapproval of the plan to make a soldier
of John. Her objections were finally overcome,
and she consented, partly because she believed
her boy when he said "there would not be a gun
fired for a hundred years" and partly because
she was even more eager than he for him to
obtain a good education.</p>






<p>Thirty years afterward General Pershing
himself wrote: "The proudest days of my life,
with one exception, have come to me in connection
with West Point days that stand out clear
and distinct from all others. The first of these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
was the day I won my appointment at Trenton,
Missouri, in a competitive examination with
seventeen competitors. An old friend of the
family happened to be at Trenton that day and
passing on the opposite side of the street called
to me and said, 'John, I hear you passed with
flying colors.' In all seriousness, feeling the
great importance of my success, I naively replied
in a loud voice, 'Yes, I did,' feeling assured
that no one had ever passed such a fine

<p>In spite of his success, however, Pershing
was not yet ready to take up the strenuous
course in the Military Academy. The work
is severe and only the fittest are supposed to
survive. He must have a more careful preparation
in certain branches, he decided, and
accordingly entered the Highland Military
Academy, Highland Falls, New York, in which
he continued as a student until the following
June (1882). The head of the school was sincerely
loved and deeply respected by his boys,
and in after years General Pershing usually
referred to him as "splendid old Caleb"&mdash;for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
"Caleb" was the title the students had bestowed
upon Col. Huse.</p>

<p>In the military school Pershing's record is
much what one who has followed his development
in the preceding years would expect it to
be. He was an earnest, consistent student,
doing well and steadily improving in his work,
without any flashes of brilliancy. He was moving
not by leaps but steadily toward the education
he was determined to obtain.</p>

<p>Those who recall him as a pupil at Highland
say that he is best remembered for his physical
strength and his skill as a horseman. Doubtless
he had had training and experiences which
were outside those which many of his classmates
had shared.</p>

<p>At last in July, 1882, when he was not quite
twenty-two years of age, Pershing became a
plebe in the United States Military Academy at
West Point. A part of his dream had been realized.
His record shows that he still was manifesting
the traits he already had displayed.
Persistent, determined, methodical, a hard and
steady worker, he was numbered thirty when he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
graduated in his class of seventy-seven. However,
his "all around" qualities were shown by
the fact that in his fourth class or final year,
upon the recommendation of the commandant
of Cadets, he was appointed by the Superintendent
of the Academy to be the senior, that is,
first in rank, of all the cadet captains&mdash;an honor
worth while and of which Pershing was justly
proud.</p>

<p>His love of West Point has always been
strong. He is proud of the school and proud
to be counted among its graduates. Loyal in
all ways he has been specially loyal to West
Point. Perhaps his true feeling can be best
shown by the following letter written by him
when he was in far-away Mindanao. He was
class president at the time and sent the letter
for the twenty-fifth anniversary of the graduation
of the class. Like many an "old grad"
the thoughts of the writer turn affectionately
to the old days. The joys and disappointments
are alike remembered and General Pershing
shows a slight tendency to recall an occasional<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
slip in the strict rules of the institution. This
infraction is not upheld by him, and his friends,
who are fully aware of his belief in strict discipline,
will perhaps condone the slight infringement
when they are aware that he records also
the strict penalty which followed it. He indirectly
shows that the infraction was due not to
a desire to avoid a task but came of a grim determination
to accomplish it.</p>

To the Class of 1886,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">U. S. Military Academy,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">West Point, New York.</span><br />


<span class="smcap">Dear Classmates:</span>

<p>The announcement in the circular sent out by
your committee saying that I would write a letter of
greeting to be read at the class reunion imposes upon
me a very pleasant obligation. It gives me an opportunity
as Class President to write you collectively
and to say many things that I would like to say if
I were writing to each individual. Above all, however,
I am permitted to feel myself a real part of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
reunion. This letter shall be a heartfelt and sincere
word of greeting from the opposite side of the world.
I shall try to imagine myself among you around the
banquet table or perhaps again in the old tower room,
first floor, first division, or familiarly even in the
"usual place." With this greeting I also send a word
of explanation and regret for my absence, a few lines
of reminiscence and pages of affection and friendship
for all recorded at random.</p>

<p>It is unfortunate indeed for me that higher authority
has concluded that I should not leave my post at
this time. This is a great disappointment to me. There
is nothing that could equal the pleasure of meeting
once more with old '86&mdash;companions of my youth,
the friendship for whom is above all others the dearest
and most lasting. To be again for a few hours
as in the olden days at West Point with those who
stood shoulder to shoulder with me and I with them
through over four years, would be worth a great sacrifice.
The thought makes me long for cadet days
again. I would gladly go back into the corps
(although of course it has gone entirely to the dogs
since we were cadets) and gladly (in spite of this)
go through the whole course from beginning to end
to be with you all as we were then. Life meant so
much to us&mdash;probably more than it ever has since&mdash;when
the soul was filled to the utmost with ambition
and the world was full of promise.</p>

<p>The proudest days of my life, with one exception,
have come to me in connection with West Point days<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
that stand out clear and distinct from all others. The
first of these was the day I won my appointment at
Trenton, Missouri, in a competitive examination with
seventeen competitors. An old friend of the family
happened to be at Trenton that day and passing on
the opposite side of the street, called to me and said,
"John, I hear you passed with flying colors." In all
seriousness, feeling the great importance of my success,
I naively replied, in a loud voice, "Yes, I did,"
feeling assured that no one had ever quite passed such
a fine examination as I had. The next red letter day
was when I was elected President of the Class of '86.
I didn't know much about class presidents until the
evening of our meeting to effect a class organization.
To realize that a body of men for whom I had such
an affectionate regard should honor me in this way
was about all my equilibrium would stand. Another
important day was when I made a cold max in Phil.
at June examination under dear old Pete, with
Arthur Murray as instructor. This was the only max
I ever made in anything. I fairly floated out of the
library and back to the barracks. The climax of days
came when the marks were read out on graduation
day in June, 1886. Little Eddy Gayle smiled when
I reported five minutes later with a pair of captain's
chevrons pinned on my sleeves. No honor has ever
come equal to that. I look upon it in the very same
light to-day as I did then. Some way these days
stand out and the recollection of them has always
been to me a great spur and stimulus.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>What memories come rushing forward to be recorded.
It was at Colonel Huse's school, now called
The Rocks, I believe, with splendid old Caleb at its
head that several of us got the first idea of what we
were really in for. Deshon, Frier, Winn, Andrews,
Clayton, Billy Wright, Stevens, Segare and the rest
of us at Caleb's used to wrestle with examinations of
previous years and flyspeck page after page of stuff
that we forgot completely before Plebe camp was over.</p>


<p>This brings up a period of West Point life whose
vivid impressions will be the last to fade. Marching
into camp, piling bedding, policing company streets
for logs or wood carelessly dropped by upper classmen,
pillow fights at tattoo with Marcus Miller, sabre
drawn marching up and down superintending the
plebe class, policing up feathers from the general
parade; light artillery drills, double timing around
old Fort Clinton at morning squad drill, Wiley Bean
and the sad fate of his seersucker coat; midnight
dragging, and the whole summer full of events can
only be mentioned in passing. No one can ever forget
his first guard tour with all its preparation and
perspiration. I got along all right during the day,
but at night on the color line my troubles began.
Of course, I was scared beyond the point of properly
applying any of my orders. A few minutes after
taps, ghosts of all sorts began to appear from all
directions. I selected a particularly bold one and
challenged according to orders, "Halt, who comes
there?" At that the ghost stood still in its tracks.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
I then said, "Halt, who stands there?" Whereupon
the ghost, who was carrying a chair, sat down. When
I promptly said, "Halt, who sits there?"</p>

<p>After plebe camp came plebe math and French. I
never stood high in French and was prone to burn
the midnight oil. One night Walcott and Burtley
Mott came in to see me. My <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'roommate'">room-mate</ins> , "Lucy" Hunt,
was in bed asleep. Suddenly we heard Flaxy, who
was officer in charge, coming up the stairs several
steps at a time. Mott sprang across the hall into his
own room. I snatched the blanket from the window,
turned out the light and leaped into bed, clothing and
all, while Walcott seeing escape impossible, gently
woke Hunt, and in a whisper said, "Lucy, may I
crawl under your bed?" I paid the penalty by
walking six tours of extra duty.</p>

<p>The rest of it&mdash;yearling camp and its release from
plebedom, the first appearance in the riding hall of
the famous '86 New England Cavalry, furlough and
the return up the Hudson on the <i>Mary Powell</i>; second
year class with its increasing responsibilities and
dignity&mdash;must all be passed with slight notice. While
the days were not always filled with unalloyed pleasure,
to be sure, yet no matter how distasteful anything
else may have been up to that time there is
none of us who would not gladly live first class camp
over again&mdash;summer girls, summer hops, first class
privileges, possible engagements, twenty-eighth hop,
and then the home stretch. As we look back from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
distance of a quarter of a century the years went by
all too rapidly.</p>

<p>The career of '86 at West Point was in many respects
remarkable. There were no cliques, no dissensions
and personal prejudices or selfishness, if any
existed, never came to the surface. From the very
day we entered, the class as a unit has always stood
for the very best traditions of West Point. The spirit
of old West Point existed to a higher degree in the
class of '86 than in any class since the war. The
West Point under Merritt, Michie and Hasbrouck was
still the West Point of Grant, Sherman, Sheridan,
Schofield and Howard. The deep impression these
great men made during their visits to West Point
in our day went far to inspire us with the soldier's
spirit of self-sacrifice, duty and honor. Those characteristics
were carried with us into the Army and
have marked the splendid career of the class during
the past twenty-five years. The Class of '86 has
always been known in the Army and is known to-day
as a class of all-around solid men&mdash;capable of ably
performing any duty and of loyally fulfilling any
trust. The individual character of each man has
made itself felt upon his fellows in the Army from
the start. In civil life, as professional men, or as men
of affairs, wherever placed the Class of '86 has always
made good. Well may we congratulate ourselves
upon reaching this quarter century milestone, on the
achievements of the class.</p>

<p>If I thought you would listen longer I should continue,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
but the evening will be full of song and reminiscence.
Those of us out here will assemble at Manila
and wish we were with you at West Point. It may be
that age and experience will prevent a repetition of
the lurid scenes enacted at the class dinner in New
York in '86. Yet when you feel time turn backward
and the hot blood of those days again courses through
your veins, there is no telling what may happen.
Still all will be for the glory of the Class and will
be condoned. Then here's to the Class of '86, wives
and sweethearts, children and grandchildren, your
health and your success!</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">Always affectionately,</span><br />

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Fighting the Apaches and the Sioux</span></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">At</span> last the days at West Point were ended
and the class of '86 was to take its place with
others in the wide, wide world. To young
Pershing fell the lot to be assigned to the Sixth
Cavalry in the southwest, where General Miles,
the successor of General Crook, was soon to
bring the war against the Apaches to an end.
He was then a second lieutenant.</p>

<p>The wily and daring leader of the redmen
was commonly known as Geronimo, a medicine
man and prophet of the Chiricahuas. Strictly
speaking, the Indian's true name was Goyathlay,
"one who yawns," but the Mexicans had
nicknamed him Geronimo&mdash;the Spanish for
Jerome.</p>

<p>This Indian was born about 1834, near the
headquarters of the Gila River, in New Mexico.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
He was the son of Taklishim, "The Gray
One." Neither the father nor the son was
a chief, although Geronimo's grandfather
claimed to be a chieftain without having been
born to the purple or elected by the tribe.</p>

<p>In 1876, the Mexican authorities complained
bitterly to the United States of the raids and
depredations in the state of Sonora by the
Chiricahua Indians with the result that it was
decided by the Government to remove the tribe
from their reservation on the southern border,
to San Carlos, Arizona. But Geronimo, who
was a natural leader, soon gathered a few of
the younger chiefs about him and fled into
Mexico.</p>

<p>Later, he was arrested and sent with his
band to Ojo Caliente, New Mexico. There, apparently,
thoughts of war were abandoned and
the redmen became successful tillers of the soil
in the San Carlos Reservation.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 478px;">
<img src="images/i-080.jpg" width="478" height="600" alt="The Lieutenant in the Family" title="" />
<span class="caption">The Lieutenant in the Family</span>
</div>

<p>After a time, the tribe once more became restless
and discontented because the Government
would not help them to irrigate their lands.
Just how much justice was in the claim it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
impossible now to ascertain. Other nearby
lands were being watered and this favoritism,
as they believed, as well as the competition of
the neighboring ranches, doubtless had a strong
effect on the Indians. At all events, in 1882,
Geronimo was the leader of a band that was
engaged in many raids in Sonora, but at last
his force was surrounded and he surrendered to
General George H. Crook in the Sierra Madre.</p>

<p>In spite of the fact that Geronimo had one
of the very best farms in the entire San Carlos
Reservation, the Apache leader soon was again
in trouble with the United States in 1884, when
attempts were made to stop the making and
sale of tiswin. This was an Indian drink and
highly intoxicating.</p>

<p>In 1884-5, Geronimo gathered and led a band
of Apaches that not only terrorized the settlers
in southern Arizona and New Mexico, but also
the inhabitants of Sonora and Chihuahua in
Mexico. General Crook was ordered to proceed
against the raiders and to capture or kill the
chief and his followers. The story of the war
is filled with exciting deeds of daring, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
through them all Geronimo looms as the foremost
figure. His name came to inspire terror.</p>

<p>At last in March, 1886, a truce was made and
this was followed by a conference, at which
terms of surrender were agreed upon. But the
wily Geronimo was not yet caught. Again
with a band of his devoted followers he fled to
the Sierra Madre mountains, beyond the borders
of Mexico.</p>

<p>General Miles was now in command of the
United States troops and quickly he began an
energetic campaign against the Apache outlaws.
This continued until August, when the
war came to an end. The entire band of 340
were made prisoners and the warfare at last
was ended. Geronimo and Nachi (the latter a
hereditary chieftain of the tribe, though his
comrade was the real leader), were sent as
prisoners of war to Florida. Later they were
removed to Alabama and at last were settled
near Fort Sill, Oklahoma. There, Geronimo
evidently concluded (and his conclusion was the
more easily arrived at because he was under
the continual supervision of United States soldiers)<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
that he had had a sufficiency of war and
that henceforth he was to be a man of peace.
He became prosperous, and was a most cautious
spender of his money.</p>

<p>The part which Lieutenant Pershing, a young
officer fresh from West Point, had in the round-up
of this campaign naturally was not of a character
to bring him into great prominence. That
he did his work well and that he had the full confidence
of his men, however, are evidenced from
the following incidents which remain among the
reports of the campaign.</p>

<p>In the autumn maneuver in 1887, he was specially
complimented by General Miles for
"marching his troops with a pack train of 140
mules in 46 hours and bringing in every animal
in good condition." Doubtless his early experiences
in dealing with mules on a Missouri farm
had stood him in good stead.</p>

<p>Another instance of his courage and his ability
to deal with men, even at this early stage in
his career, was shown when word came of the
dire predicament of a score of "bad men"&mdash;horse
thieves and cow-punchers&mdash;who had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
surrounded by the Indians and were threatened
with the death of every one in the band unless
they should be speedily rescued. The young
lieutenant with his detachment not only succeeded
in penetrating to their refuge, but also
in saving every one of them without the loss of
the life of one man, white or red. The same
qualities that had been displayed in his student
days were here again in evidence. His sense of
duty was still strong upon him and quietly, persistently,
he worked hard to do his best.</p>

<p>There still was work for the lieutenant on the
border, for the troubles with the Indian tribes
were by no means ended. His service on frontier
duty at Fort Bayard, New Mexico, and in
the field from July 30, 1886, to July 30, 1887,
was followed by duty at Fort Stanton, New
Mexico.</p>

<p>He went to Fort Wingate, New Mexico, in
February, 1889, remaining there until September
1, 1889. He then returned to Fort Stanton
to stay until September, 1890, when again he
was sent to Fort Wingate.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>At Fort Wingate, with the exception of a
few weeks spent in scout duty, he remained until
December 1, 1890, when he was transferred to
take the field in the campaign against the Sioux
Indians at Pine Ridge Agency, South Dakota.
In February, 1891, he was stationed at Fort
Niobrara, in Nebraska, only to return to the
Pine Ridge Agency to take command of the
Sioux Indian Scouts until July of the same
year. Again he was with his troops at Fort
Niobrara, remaining until August 7, 1891, when
he was in command of a detachment (rifle team)
en route to Fort Sheridan, Illinois. On September
25th he became Professor of Military
Science and Tactics at the University of Nebraska
at Lincoln, Nebraska.</p>

<p>This brief record, however, does not cover all
that the young officer was doing. Studying and
at the same time working hard at his duties,
he was already laying the foundations for that
which later was to come. At the time, however,
his future career seemed vague if not impossible.
Indeed, he himself was almost convinced
that war had ceased to be a threat among the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
nations. "There won't be a gun fired in a hundred
years," he had declared to a friend when
he was about to enter West Point, and the
thoughts of the young officer reverted to the
law for which in his younger days he had
almost decided to prepare.</p>

<p>That he was not without suggestions and desires
to improve the conditions in the army is
shown by the following letter which he wrote
the <i>Journal of United States Cavalry</i> in 1889:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><div class='center'>[Journal of U. S. Cavalry, December, 1889.]<br />

<span class="smcap">Some Hints for Improvement.</span></div>

<p>More prominence should be given to the revolver
competitions and some changes might be made in the
manner of conducting them. We should have a regular
revolver competition and teams with competitors
one from each troop held every morning, best pistol
shots in the troop, and not have pistol competition
supplementary to carbine competition though the two
might be held at the same time and place.</p>

<p>In connection with the army carbine competition
there should be an army revolver, competitors to be
selected from the various revolver teams as they are
held for the army carbine competitions.</p>

<p>Prizes for the revolver teams should be the same
as those awarded to the infantry department and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
for the army revolver team the same as those
awarded to the infantry division teams.</p>

<p>No good reason can be seen why dismounted revolver
firing should not be held at the three ranges,
25, 50 and 75 yards, the same as for individual record
in the troop. In the mounted firing, both in troops
and practice competitions, no gait slower than ten
miles and a half should be permitted. These changes
would give a stimulus to revolver firing in the army
which would bring about surprising results.</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span style="margin-right: 3em;"><span class="smcap">J. J. Pershing</span>,</span><br />
Second Lieutenant, 6th Cavalry.<br />
</div></div>

<p>In the part which Lieutenant Pershing took
against the Sioux, he was sharing conditions
which were by no means slight or insignificant.
The Sioux were notably brave and bold and
more than once their chiefs had outgeneraled
the trained white soldiers that fought them.</p>

<p>It is difficult to determine at this time just
where to place the blame for these wars with
the Sioux. The stories of the causes of the outbreak
told by the Indians themselves differ
radically from those which were given by certain
of the whites, but whatever the true cause
may have been, young Pershing had nothing to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
do with that. He was simply obeying orders
and doing his best in the war with the redmen
who already confronted him.</p>

<p>Sitting Bull in particular was a strong and
successful fighter. Crazy Horse, a bold and
able chief, had, as the Sioux believed, been
treacherously seized and bayoneted by the
whites. Indeed, one of their rallying cries in
the campaign was, "Remember our Chief,
Crazy Horse."</p>

<p>General George A. Custer and nearly every
one of his soldiers had been killed in a battle on
the plains, in which the Indian leaders had
succeeded in first surrounding Custer's force.
Pa-he-hors-kah-zee (Long Yellow Hair), as the
redmen had named Custer, was respected and
greatly feared by them and for that reason they
did their utmost to shoot him first of all when
he finally took his stand in the center of the
hollow square, into which he formed his troops
when he discovered, after the breaking out of
the battle, that he and his men were nearly
surrounded.</p>

<p>The death of General Custer greatly angered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
the whites, and it was promptly decided that
once for all they would put an end to the uprisings
of the strong and wily Sioux. This result,
of course, was at last accomplished and in
the final battle Lieutenant Pershing had his
part. This battle, which the whites call
Wounded Knee and the Indians term The
Massacre at Wounded Knee Creek, was won
when the troops finally surrounded the tepees
of the redmen and then demanded that every
gun should be given over.</p>

<p>This demand the Sioux refused, declaring
that their experiences with the whites did not
warrant them in making themselves entirely
defenseless. They also explained that they
themselves had bought and paid for every gun
in the possession of the tribe.</p>

<p>This explanation or refusal was declared to
be unsatisfactory. The command to attack
quickly was given, the soldiers fired obediently
and the report was made that they shot down
every man, woman and child, with few exceptions,
in the Indian village.</p>

<p>Thus the great Indian wars came to an end<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
and whatever may have been his feelings concerning
the justice of the methods employed to
subdue the Sioux, Lieutenant Pershing did not
speak. He was a young officer and his part was
not to explain, but to obey.</p>

<p>In September, 1891, he became Professor of
Military Science and Tactics at the University
of Nebraska.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Military Instructor</span></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the University of Nebraska the young
instructor-lieutenant revolutionized his department.
It is said that when first the students
presented themselves before him, according to
the rules of the University, for drill, their preparations
were nil and their appearance was far
from being prepossessing. Previously the military
drill had been more or less looked upon
by the student body as a somewhat necessary
but negligible and irksome task. Few prepared
carefully for it and all were glad when the hour
ended.</p>

<p>Under the new instructor the change was
startling and immediate&mdash;and the college boys
liked it. Among the strict demands of the new
instructor was one that required every student<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
when he appeared for drill to have his boots
well blacked. Not only must the toes of the
boots appear well, but every boy must see to
it that the heels also received proper attention.
Perhaps Lieutenant Pershing was interpreting
for the Nebraska boys the familiar old proverb,
"Black the heels of your boots."</p>

<p>The new professor speedily became popular,
for no man is more unpopular in a student body
than the teacher who weakly condones their
neglect or too readily excuses their deficiencies.
In spite of their protests to the contrary, they
like the strict work and the fair and exacting
teacher. And Pershing was liked&mdash;and liked
more because he did not try to secure the goodwill
of his students.</p>

<p>The impression which the new instructor in
military tactics made upon the student body
is well shown by the following statement of
the director of athletics in the University at
that time, who naturally co&ouml;perated with the
official representative of the Government whose
influence over the college boys speedily became
pronounced.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"He was the finest man I ever worked with," said
Best. "It is true he was mighty strict with his work,
but the results he got were so good that everybody
he worked with loved him for it. When he was here
we had a regiment the University could be proud
of. I just worshipped that man and everybody
around the University felt the same about him.</p>

<p>"Usually he was mighty dignified in his work, but
he had a way of getting next to the new men.</p>

<p>"The boys at the University got a surprise the first
time Pershing drilled them. It had been their habit
before this time to come to drill with shoes blackened
or not, just as they pleased. When Pershing took
hold the first thing he looked at was to see that all
shoes were well blackened and that the heels looked
as good as the toes. He was just that thorough-going
in everything all the time."&mdash;From the <i>New York
Times</i>.</p></div>

<p>An incident recently told by one of his students
in the University of Nebraska also is
illustrative of the grip the drillmaster had
upon the student body.</p>

<p>When Lieutenant Pershing later was appointed
to a new position in the Army there was
keen disappointment among the students, all
of whom were his strong admirers. Certain
of his cadets, who had profited greatly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
under his discipline and served under his
orders, got together and decided that they
wanted to wear badges of some kind. Gold
medals were suggested, but for obvious reasons
were not selected. Then one of the cadets suggested
a plan as novel as it was new, and after
a hearty laugh a delegation went to Lieutenant
Pershing to ask for the gift of his riding
trousers.</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" exclaimed the astonished instructor
in tactics. "What do you want of my
trousers?"</p>

<p>The students then explained their plan.
They were to cut the trousers into such small
bits that both the blue of the cloth and the
yellow of the border would be found in every
piece. Of these little strips they would make
badges&mdash;one for every cadet.</p>

<p>The lieutenant promptly presented his visitors
with his best pair.</p>

<p>One of the little band in relating the incident
not long ago said, "We made the badges, which
as far as I know were the first service badges
ever used in the United States. If I could only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
buy, borrow, beg or steal one of those badges
I'd readily wear it in France by the side of my
ribbon of the Spanish-American war."</p>

<p>With duties that were not arduous Lieutenant
Pershing now not only continued his
studies, particularly in strategy, but also found
time to carry out the desire and plan that more
or less had been in his thoughts since his boyhood&mdash;he
took the course in law as it was given
in the University. From this course he graduated
and consequently was entitled to write
another title after his name&mdash;that of Bachelor
of Laws. He then was "Professor" Lieutenant
John Joseph Pershing, A.B., "Esquire."</p>

<p>However, he was soon to become first lieutenant
in the 10th U. S. Cavalry&mdash;a promotion
which he received October 20, 1892. Joining
his troop on October 11, 1895, he was again sent
into the service with the 10th Cavalry at Fort
Assinniboine, Montana, where he remained
until October 16, 1896. In June and July of
that year the monotony of life in the fort was
varied by service in the field, where he assisted
in deporting the Cree Indians.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>A brief leave of absence followed this work
on the frontier, but on December 17, 1896, he
was assigned to duties at the Headquarters of
the Army at Washington. This inside work,
however, did not strongly appeal to the active
young lieutenant, and in May of the following
year he rejoined his regiment at Fort Assinniboine,
Montana.</p>

<p>Here, however, his stay was to be very brief
at this time. Promotion apparently had been
slow, and doubtless many a time the heart of
the ambitious young officer must have been
somewhat heavy. The teachings of his father,
however, were now bearing fruit and not for a
moment did Lieutenant Pershing relax his
steady, persistent labors. Whether recognition
and promotion came or not he was to be prepared.</p>

<p>But the quiet, efficient young officer had not
been unnoticed or forgotten by those who were
higher in authority. At this time a new instructor
in military tactics was needed in the
United States Military Academy at West
Point. What could be more natural than that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
the choice should fall upon Pershing? He was
a hard worker, he had seen active service on the
plains, he had learned how to deal with men,
and, besides, he had had actual experience in
teaching tactics when he had been stationed
at the University of Nebraska. And behind the
experience was a personality quiet, modest and
marvelously efficient. Lieutenant John Joseph
Pershing was assigned to duty at the United
States Military Academy as Assistant Instructor
of Tactics, June 15, 1897.</p>

<p>To be back again in the well-remembered and
beloved institution where he himself had been
trained was a joy and honor. His devotion to and
appreciation of West Point strengthened and
intensified by his experiences in the years that
had intervened since his graduation, we may be
sure that the heart of Lieutenant Pershing was
proud of the confidence which had been manifested
in his selection to fill the vacant position.</p>

<p>Here again there was a continuance of his
previous record of quiet and efficient service.
It is true he was older now and he was more
ready for the public and social duties of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
position than perhaps he had been in his earlier
days. And to the social side of his new task
he responded as became one in his position.</p>

<p>It was not long, however, before a fresh opportunity
presented itself&mdash;the one for which
he had been waiting. The troubles between
Spain and the Island of Cuba had for a considerable
time been threatening to involve the
United States. Many people sympathized
with the Cubans in their longing and their efforts
to secure their independence. The sturdy
fight which the Islanders were making appealed
strongly to many patriotic Americans
who were glorying in the traditions of the
struggle their own forefathers had made a
century and a quarter earlier.</p>

<p>The friction between the United States and
Spain steadily increased. The latter nation,
perhaps not without a certain justification,
was claiming that her colonists were fitting out
expeditions and obtaining munitions and supplies
for their soldiers in the cities of the
United States, a supposedly neutral nation.
She was not unnaturally irritated, too, by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
steadily increasing numbers of Americans that
were serving in the hard pressed and poorly
equipped troops of Cuba. The culmination,
however, came when the United States battleship,
<i>Maine</i>, was blown up in the harbor of
Havana, February 15, 1898. The long delayed
declaration of war by the United States, April
21, 1898, was the speedy outcome.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">In the Spanish War</span></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Lieutenant Pershing</span> instantly grasped his
long awaited opportunity. He resigned his
position at West Point, and at once was sent to
his regiment, the 10th Cavalry, then at Chicamauga,
and afterwards near Tampa, Florida,
but in June of that same year he went to Cuba
and shared in the campaign against Santiago.
Many have thought that the nickname "Black
Jack" was affectionately given him because he
was such a daring and dashing leader of the
exceptionally brave black men of whom the 10th
U. S. Cavalry at that time was composed.</p>

<p>In this campaign no official records can have
quite the same human touch as the words of
the modest young officer himself. In a lecture
or address in the Hyde Park M. E. Church,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Chicago, November 27, 1898, the church whose
founding was largely due to the interest and
labors of his father,&mdash;Lieutenant Pershing
described the experiences and deeds of his
troop. The interest at the time was keen in
the campaign he described. To-day, however,
the interest is still keener in the young lieutenant
who gave his vivid description of the
battles in which he shared.</p>

<p>Address by Lieutenant Pershing at the
Hyde Park M. E. Church, Chicago, at a patriotic
Thanksgiving service, November 27, 1898:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The admonition of George Washington, "In peace
prepare for war," had gone unheeded for one-third
of a century. Congress had turned a deaf ear to
the importunities of our military commanders. The
staff departments of the army were only large
enough to meet the ordinary necessities in times of
peace of an army of 25,000 men. They had not transported
even by rail for over thirty years a larger
command than a regiment. In the face of all this
every official both civil and military of staff and line
seemingly did his best to overcome these adverse conditions
and though of course mistakes were made I
should hesitate to attribute to any individual other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
than the purest motives of patriotism. The wonder is
it was done at all. The wonder is it was done so well.
The point of embarkation for the first army of invasion
was Port Tampa, Florida. There was some
delay in the embarkation due to various causes one
of which was the inexperience of officers in transporting
troops by water. Another cause of delay was
uncertainty as to whether or not the Spanish fleet was
really confined in the harbor of Santiago.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of June 14th, the fleet steamed
out under its naval escort and a grander and more
impressive sight the world has never seen.</p>

<p>Arriving in the vicinity of Santiago some time was
spent in deciding where to attempt a landing. Two
plans were proposed, one an attack from the west,
which was said would involve, with the assistance
of the navy, the capture of the outer defenses of the
harbor of <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Sanitago'">Santiago</ins> . The other plan, the one which
was adopted, ignored the existence of Morro Castle
and the coast defenses and contemplated an attack on
the city from the rear. This decided, a point of debarkation
was selected at Daiquiri. There were no
good maps of Cuba and very little was known of the
coast or country.</p>

<p>At Daiquiri the navy prepared the way for landing
by bombarding the town and driving out the
Spanish troops who before leaving set fire to the
buildings of the town and the machine shops and the
mines located there. There were no docks at Daiquiri
except a small wooden affair, old and out of repair.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
The vessels could not go nearer than about 300 yards
from the shore and then only in calm weather.</p>

<p>Nothing was taken ashore with the troops except
what they carried on their backs, but the load was so
heavy that to fall overboard in deep water meant to
be drowned, though from the entire army but two
men were lost.</p>

<p>On the morning of June 23d, the Tenth Cavalry,
together with the First Cavalry and Roosevelt's
Rough Riders and regiments which formed the second
brigade of the cavalry division, were sent ashore
and moved out northwest passing through Siboney
to a point beyond the most advanced outposts toward
Santiago. These troops though belonging to the
cavalry were dismounted and in marching through
marsh and bog overhung with boughs and vines,
clad as they were in heavy clothing, they soon began
to feel the wilting effects of the tropical sun; but
every man had resolved for the honor of his country
to make the best of the situation as a soldier and
whether working or marching or fighting all behaved
as though the success of the campaign depended upon
their own individual efforts.</p>

<p>On July 10th, the day set for the ultimatum of the
bombardment, the white flags of truce were again
taken down and the men again climbed into the
trenches. At four o'clock in the afternoon at the
signal of the first gun from our northern battery the
firing began and the battle raged with the same old
fury as of those early July days; shells and bullets<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
whistled violently for a few minutes but the enemy's
fire gradually died away into silence. They realized
their helplessness and the battle was over.</p>

<p>Our reinforcements had begun to arrive and the
terms of capitulation dictated by the commanding
general were soon agreed upon. On the morning of
July 17th the lines of both armies were drawn up to
witness the formal surrender. General Toral with an
infantry escort rode out from the city to meet General
Shafter, who was escorted by a squadron of
mounted cavalry. The formalities were courteous
though simple. Arms were presented by both commanders
and the Spanish General tendered his sword
to our commander.</p>

<p>General Shafter, accompanied by all the general and
staff officers, his escort of cavalry and one regiment
of infantry, then entered the city.</p>

<p>Shortly before twelve o'clock our troops were again
drawn up in line along the six miles of trenches and
stood at present arms. An officer ascended to the top
of the Governor's palace and lowered the Spanish
colors and now held the Stars and Stripes, impatient
to declare our victory to the world. Suddenly at
exactly twelve o'clock the enthusiasm burst forth, cannon
boomed the national salute, bands played the Star
Spangled Banner, hats were thrown into the air and
ten thousand men as if to burst their throats joined
in one grand American yell. There just beyond the
hill outlined against the clear sky, over the Governor's
palace in the captured city, though invisible to many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
of us floated our own beloved flag. The campaign
was over. For us the war was ended.</p>

<p>On June 29th a part of General Garcia's Army
with some 4000 Cubans were marched to the front,
but they rendered little assistance, either in working
or fighting. The most of them fled at the first explosion
of a Spanish shell over El Pozo Capital Hill
on July 1st. However, some excuse is theirs. Ragged,
some half naked, wearied from hunger, laden with
huge earthen water pots, heavy packs and cooking
utensils slung over their backs, armed with every conceivable
obsolete pattern of gun, it is no wonder
that they dared not face the deadly Mauser rifle; we
ourselves had much less contempt for Spanish arms
after we had met them face to face on the battle field.</p>

<p>On June 30th the general order came to move forward
and every man felt that the final test of skill at
arms would soon come. The cavalry division of six
regiments camped in its tracks at midnight on El
Pozo Hill, awoke next morning to find itself in support
of Grimes' Battery which was to open fire here
on the left.</p>

<p>The morning of July 1st was ideally beautiful;
the sky was cloudless and the air soft and balmy;
peace seem to reign supreme, great palms towered
here and there above the low jungle. It was a picture
of a peaceful valley. There was a feeling that we had
secretly invaded the Holy Land. The hush seemed to
pervade all nature as though she held her bated
breath in anticipation of the carnage.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>Captain Capron's field guns had opened fire upon
the southern field at El Caney and the hill resounded
with echoes. Then followed the reply of the musketry
of the attacking invaders. The fighting in our front
burst forth and the battle was on.</p>

<p>The artillery duel began and in company with
foreign military attach&eacute;s and correspondents we all
sat watching the effect of the shots as men witness
any fine athletic contest eagerly trying to locate their
smokeless batteries. A force of insurgents near the
old Sugar Mill cowered at the explosion of each firing
charge apparently caring for little except the noise.</p>

<p>A slug of iron now and then fell among the surrounding
bushes or buried itself deep in the ground
near us. Finally a projectile from an unseen Spanish
gun discharged a Hotchkiss piece, wounded two
cavalrymen and smashed into the old Sugar Mill in
our rear, whereupon the terrorized insurgents fled
and were not seen again near the firing line until
the battle was over.</p>

<p>When the Tenth Cavalry arrived at the crossing of
San Juan River the balloon had become lodged in the
treetops above and the enemy had just begun to
make a target of it. A converging fire upon all the
works within range opened upon us that was terrible
in its effect. Our mounted officers dismounted
and the men stripped off at the roadside everything
possible and prepared for business.</p>

<p>We were posted for a time in the bed of the stream
to the right directly under the balloon and stood in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
the water to our waists waiting orders to deploy. Remaining
there under this galling fire of exploding
shrapnel and deadly Mauser bullets the minutes
seemed like hours. General Wheeler and a part of
his staff stood mounted a few minutes in the middle
of the stream. Just as I raised my hat to salute in
passing up the stream to pass the squadron of my
regiment, a piece of bursting shell struck between us
and covered us both with water. Pursuant to orders
from its commander, with myself as guide, the second
squadron of the Tenth forced its way through
wire fence and almost <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'inpenetrable'">impenetrable</ins>  thicket to its position.
The regiment was soon deployed as skirmishers
in an opening across the river to the right of the
road and our line of skirmishers being partly visible
from the enemy's position, their fire was turned upon
us and we had to lie down in the grass a few minutes
for safety. Two officers of the regiment were
wounded; here and there were frequent calls for the
surgeon.</p>

<p>White regiments, black regiments, regulars and
rough riders representing the young manhood of the
North and South fought shoulder to shoulder unmindful
of race or color, unmindful of whether commanded
by an ex-confederate or not, and mindful only of
their common duty as Americans.</p>

<p>Through streams, tall grass, tropical undergrowth,
under barbed wire fences and over wire entanglements,
regardless of casualties up the hill to the right
this gallant advance was made. As we appeared on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
the brow of the hill we found the Spaniards retreating
only to take up a new position farther on, spitefully
firing as they retreated and only yielding their
ground inch by inch.</p>

<p>Our troopers halted and laid down but momentarily
to get a breath and in the face of continued volleys
soon formed for attack on the block houses and intrenchments
on the second hill. This attack was supported
by troops including some of the Tenth who had
originally moved to the left toward this second hill
and had worked their way in groups slipping through
the tall grass and bushes, crawling when casualties
came too often, courageously facing a sleet of bullets
and now hung against the steep southern declivity
ready to spring the few remaining yards into the
teeth of the enemy. The fire from the Spanish position
had doubled in intensity. There was a moment's
lull and our line moved forward to the charge across
the valley separating the two hills. Once begun it
continued dauntless in its steady, dogged, persistent
advance until like a mighty resistless challenge it
dashed triumphant over the crest of the hill and firing
a parting volley at the vanishing foe planted the
silken standard on the enemy's breastworks and the
Stars and Stripes over the block house on San Juan
Hill to stay.</p>

<p>This was a time for rejoicing. It was glorious.</p></div>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>But among the scenes of rejoicing there was others
of sadness. Both American and Spanish troops lay<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
dead and wounded around us; all were cared for
alike. I saw a colored trooper stop at a trench filled
with Spanish dead and wounded and gently raise the
head of a wounded Spanish lieutenant and give him
the last drop of water from his own canteen. Their
dead, of whom there were many, had fought bravely
and we buried them in the trenches where they gallantly
fell.</p>

<p>The losses of the day were heavy&mdash;the Tenth
Cavalry losing one-half of its officers and twenty per
cent of its men. We officers of the Tenth Cavalry
have taken our black heroes in our arms. They had
again fought their way into our affections, as they
here had fought their way into the hearts of the
American people. Though we had won, it had cost
us dearly.</p>

<p>An attempt was made that evening to recapture
the hill, but our defense was so strong that the attempt
was futile; the Spaniards retreating to their
first interior line of intrenchments 300 to 500 yards
away.</p>

<p>The firing on both sides was kept up until dark
and ceased only at intervals during the night. Over
El Caney the battle had raged all day, but steadily
as the Spaniards had held their positions the fierce
charges of the gallant Seventh, Twelfth and Twenty-fifth
regiments of infantry were resistless. Soon after
San Juan was ours, El Caney fell.</p>

<p>By morning the position was strengthened so that
our line was fairly well protected, reveill&eacute; was sounded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
by Spanish small arms and artillery in chorus, but
the signal had been anticipated and all men were in
their places at the firing line.</p>

<p>Daylight was breaking in the east when both sides
began where they had left off the night before and
the firing all day was incessant. A few moments
after the firing opened, some cannoneers permitted a
limber from one of the guns of the light battery near
us to get away and it went rolling down the hillside
to the rear for a quarter of a mile. Our artillery was
silenced by the enemy's small arms and compelled to
take up a new position; strong shrapnel went screeching
over head and bursting beyond. The adjutant
of my regiment was stricken by a hidden sharpshooter.
The heat soon became intense and there
was no shelter and cannon balls plunged through the
lines at the top of the hill and went rolling to the
bottom of the valley; bullets spattered against the
isolated trees or grazed the newly made earthworks
covering with dirt the men in the trenches and fairly
mowing the grass for many yards in our front. Thus
the day went on and the night and the succeeding
day began. Then came the welcome truth; everybody
drew a long breath and thanked God; it was possible
once more to walk erect; however, the echoes of the
last three days were slow to die away and at the
breaking of a bough or the rusting of a leaf there was
a temptation to duck.</p>

<p>At noon on July 4th the regiments were formed into
line and I had the pleasure of reading to my regiment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
a telegram from the President extending the
thanks and congratulations of the American people to
the army in front of Santiago for its gallantry and
success.</p>

<p>The brave Linares, however, had already realized
the hopelessness of his cause, but he would not surrender
without permission from his home government.
Therefore the city must be bombarded.
Pacificos and the non-combatants were ordered out
of the city and were permitted to come within our
lines. All day long on the dusty road leading from
Santiago to El Cancy passed the long white line;
faint, hungry women carried a bundle of clothing
and parcel of food or an infant while helpless children
trailed wearily at the skirts of their wretched
mothers. An old man tottered along on his cane and
behind him a puny lad and an aged woman; old and
young women and children and decrepit men of every
class&mdash;those refined and used to luxury together with
the ragged beggar&mdash;crowding each other in this narrow
column. It was a pitiful sight; from daylight
to dark the miserable procession trooped past. The
suffering of the innocent is not the least of the sorrows
of war.</p>

<p>The days of truce and hostilities alternated; all
roll calls were suspended except the sunset call and
retreat on days of truce.</p>

<p>At the evening call we daily ceased our chatting,
cooking or working and groups or lines of officers and
men stood with uncovered heads in respectful and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
reverent attention as the music of the Star Spangled
Banner and the sight of the flag we had planted on
the hill above us, lifted us out of ourselves and carried
us in thought to home and country; it was the
soldiers' silent Ave Maria.</p>

<p>Duty in the trenches was no less arduous because
of the few days of truce; all the available men would
report to work at strengthening positions and building
bomb-proof shelters. Vigilance never relaxed
until the capitulation. The rainy season had set in in
earnest and the trenches were at times knee deep with
mud and water. The constant exposures to the heat
and rain together with the strain of battle began to
have its effect upon even the strongest of us. Our
sick list gradually grew and the dreaded yellow fever
appeared in our ranks; the field hospitals already
overcrowded with wounded were compelled to accommodate
the increasing number of fever patients;
medical supplies and food for the sick were lacking
and though many things were furnished by the Red
Cross there was yet a shortage.</p>

<p>Since July 3d the firing from the Spanish trenches
had become irregular, desultory and non-effective.
Our artillery gunners now knew the range of every
Spanish battery and our men in the trenches&mdash;every
one a trained marksman&mdash;knew the distance of every
Spanish position. A Spanish captain told me afterward
that it was dangerous for them even to stick
up a finger for fear of having it shot off; and yet the
Spanish commander still held out.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>The literary style of the young lecturer reveals
the direct virile qualities that since have
made General Pershing one of the most forceful
and clear American writers on topics having
to do with the military affairs of the country.
His use of adjectives perhaps is somewhat
freer than in his later writings, but there
is the same vivid, direct power of expression
and description. His modesty at the time prevented
him from referring to the fact that
twice he was recommended for brevet commissions
in the war with Spain for "personal
gallantry and untiring energy and faithfulness."
Nor did he mention the words of General
Baldwin, a brave soldier of the Civil War,
who said of him: "Pershing is the coolest
man under fire I ever saw." And he makes
no mention of the earnest protest of a certain
foreign officer, the representative of his own
government in the Santiago campaign, who
begged the daring troops not to make the now
famous charge up San Juan Hill because they
would be rushing into certain death.</p>

<p>The official records, however, are now available<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
and consequently we are not dependent
upon stories which occasionally seem to possess
a snow-ball like quality of increasing in
size as they gain in distance from their starting
points.</p>

Headquarters, Tenth U. S. Cavalry,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Camp Hamilton, Cuba, July, 1898.</span><br />
Adjutant General, Second Brigade, Cavalry Division, Fifth Army Corps.<br />


<p>Sir:&mdash;I have the honor to submit the following report
of the part taken by the Tenth Cavalry in the
battle of July 12th and 13th, 1898, before Santiago
de Cuba.</p>

<p>On the morning of July 1st the regiment, consisting
of troops, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, I, field and staff, occupying
a position on the left of the second cavalry,
directed the line extending nearly north and south
on a ridge some three or four miles from Santiago.</p>

<p>At about 6:30 A. M. a battery of artillery massed a
short distance from our right opened upon the works
of Santiago, the regiment being exposed to much of
the return fire of the American batteries. After the
artillery fire had ceased the regiment moved right
past the sugar mills and proceeded in rear of the
town on the road toward Santiago. The movement
was delayed as we approached the San Juan river
and the regiment came within range of fire about
half a mile from the crossing. Upon reaching the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
river I found that the Seventy-first N. Y. Volunteers
were at the crossing and that the regiment preceding
mine had moved to the right. The Tenth Cavalry
was here subject to and confronting radically an infantry
fire from the three block houses and intrenchments
in front and the works farther to the left and
nearer Santiago. The fire was probably drawn by
a balloon which preceded the regiment to a point near
the ford where it was held. I was directed to take a
position to the right behind the river, however, for
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'potection'">protection</ins>  moving to this position and while there the
regiment suffered considerable loss. After an interval
of 20 to 30 minutes I was directed to form line
of battle in a particularly open field facing toward
the blockhouse and strong intrenchments to the
north occupied by the enemy. Much difficulty was
found on account of the dense undergrowth crossed
in several directions by wire fences. As a part of the
cavalry division under General Sumner, the regiment
was formed on two lines. The first squadron under
Major S. T. Norvall consisting of troops A, E, B and
I leading. The second line under Major T. J. Wint
consisting of troops C, F and G. Troop D having
crossed further down the river attached itself to a
command of infantry and moved with that command
on the two blockhouses. The regiment advanced in
this formation under a heavy fire from the enemy's
position proceeding but a short distance when the
two lines were reunited into one. The advance was
rapidly continued in an irregular line toward the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
blockhouses and intrenchments to the right front.
During this advance the lines passed some troops of
the first cavalry which I think had been previously
formed on our right. Several losses occurred before
reaching the top of them; first lieutenant W. H.
Smith being killed as he arrived at its crest. The
enemy having retreated toward the northwest toward
the second and third blockhouses, new lines were
formed and rapid advance was made upon the new
positions.</p>

<p>The regiment assisted in capturing these works
from the enemy and with the exception of Troops C
and I who had joined the first volunteer cavalry, then
took up a position north of the second blockhouse, remaining
there during the night. With some changes
in the positions of troops they held this line of the
second and third under a heavy and continuous fire
from the enemy's intrenchments in front and the regiment
now occupying a part of the advance intrenched
positions. Some troops lost their relative positions
in line during the first day of the battle but attached
themselves to others and continued to move forward.
During the entire engagement the regiment acted
with exceptional coolness and bravery. It held its
position at the ford and moved forward unflinchingly
after deploying through the advance under the heavy
fire from the enemy's works.</p>

<p>The officers and men in general throughout exhibited
great bravery obeying orders with unflinching
alacrity while attacking with small arms an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
enemy strongly posted in intrenchment and blockhouse
supported with artillery. Words cannot express
my gratification at such conduct and I would
request such service receive some special recognition.
It is difficult to distinguish between officers and men
all of whom are so deserving but of the officers whose
conduct on the field came under my direct personal
observation I would especially mention Major S. T.
Norvall, Major T. J. Wint, squadron commander,
first lieutenant J. J. Pershing, quartermaster, and
first lieutenant M. H. Bowman, adjutant, for their
untiring energy, faithfulness and gallantry during
this engagement and would recommend the officers
mentioned for brevet commissions, .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>In the report of Major Wint, November 28th,
1898, to the adjutant-general is the following:
"Lieutenant Pershing, R.O.M., was with the
Second Squadron when passed on Sugar House
Hill and during its advance on San Juan Hill he
conducted himself in a most gallant and efficient
manner."</p>

<p>The war with Spain was soon terminated but
the executive ability of Lieutenant Pershing
was still in demand. The period of reconstruction
was difficult then, as it always is, presenting
problems different from those of active
fighting, but no less puzzling and perplexing.
In this trying time we find him serving as an
executive under the direction of the War Department
and manifesting in his quiet, persistent
way the same qualities of efficiency which
had marked his career up to this time. On
August 18, 1898, he was serving as Major Chief
Ordnance Officer with the United States Volunteers,
remaining on duty at the Headquarters
of the Army until December 20, 1898, and then
on duty in the office of the Assistant Secretary
of War, under whom he organized the Bureau<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
of Insular Affairs, and was at the head of that
Bureau until the following August. On May
12, 1899, he was honorably discharged from Volunteer
service and on June 6, 1899, he was
Major and Assistant Adjutant General, United
States Volunteers.</p>

<p>Office and work of detail did not, however,
appeal strongly to him. Having known the life
and work in the field, and also possessed of a
temperament that demanded more active work
and out-of-door life that an office provided, at
his own request he was sent to the Philippine
Islands and was assigned to duty as Adjutant
General of the District of Mindanao and Jolo
(afterwards a Department under the same
name).</p>

<p>He became captain in the First Cavalry, February,
1901, and on August 20th of the same
year he was transferred to the Fifteenth Cavalry.
His work in the Philippine Islands continued
and there his soldierly qualities found a
larger field for development and activity than
they had known before.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">In the Philippines</span></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> supreme testing of Pershing up to this
time in his career came in the Philippines.
There he was dealing with a strange people
who for three centuries had learned their lessons
and formed their opinions of the white
men from their contact and dealings with the
Spaniards, of whom they had seen chiefly the
adventurers or those who for the "good of
their country" had fled from their homes. To
such men the exploitation of the "natives"
was a legitimate game and the little brown
men had thoroughly learned to play their part
in it.</p>

<p>The provinces in which Pershing was to find
his field of activity were as difficult as any in
the islands. For years the natives had been
accustomed to import arms from Borneo and
elsewhere. Certain of the tribes were famous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
also for their skill as forgers of swords, krises
and barongs. Every datto had numbers of
lantaka or brass cannon and was well skilled
in the use of them. Pershing's problem was
not only to subdue these men,&mdash;farmers,
artificers and all alike fighters after their own
manner, but he must also at the same time
convince them of the good will and helpful intentions
of the new Government, which for a
time and for their own good was now to control
them. Naturally suspicious, treacherous
in many ways, the Islands presented difficulties
that well might have staggered the young
officer.</p>

<p>General Pershing's first term of service in
the Philippines was from 1899 to 1903. In the
interval between his first and second terms of
service as soldier and governor in the Islands,
he was back in the United States to serve on
the General Staff and also was serving as
military attach&eacute; in the army of General
Kuroki in the war between Russia and Japan.</p>

<p>In his first years in the Philippines his work
was of a character that made him known to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
the Army and to the authorities at Washington,
but it did not make him widely known to
his countrymen.</p>

<p>Briefly stated, his record during his two
terms of service in the Philippines is as follows:
he was in the field November, 1900, to
March, 1901, against General Capistrano, the
commander of the insurrectionary forces; he
was in command of an expedition against the
hostile Moros of Maciu, starting from Camp
Vicars, Mindanao, September 18, 1902. In the
actions at Guam, September 18, and at Bayabao,
September 20, 1902, he had a responsible
part. On September 29, 1902, he captured
Fort Moru, driving the Moros from that Peninsula
on that date. He attacked the Moros
at Maciu, September 30, 1902, capturing their
two forts and then returned to Camp Vicars
October 3, 1902. He was again in action at
Bacolod, April 6-8, 1903, and again at Calabui
April 9, 1903, and Iaraca River, May 4, 1903.
He commanded the first military force that
ever encircled Lake Lanao.</p>

<p>In May, 1902, General Chaffee was desirous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
of securing a young leader to deal with the
troublesome and specific problem in the province
of Zamboanga, where the fierce and turbulent
little Moros dwelt. Many of these people
were Mohammedans and had been taught that
the swiftest and surest way to secure happiness
in the next world was by the slaughter of
Christians in this present world. During 300
years they had fought the Spanish invaders,
whose every attempt to subdue them had failed.</p>

<p>Pershing in command of five troops of the
Fifteenth Cavalry, together with a battery of
artillery, a company of engineers and a battalion
of the Twenty-seventh Infantry, was
stationed at Camp Vicars in the Lake Lanao
District of Mindanao. He had taken the place
made vacant by the promotion of Colonel Baldwin.</p>

<p>Although the Americans had obtained a foothold
on the southern side of Lake Lanao, very
few of them had actually become friendly. In
fact the Spaniards, in all the years of their occupation,
had never subdued the main tribes to
subordination.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>Among those who especially defied the American
authority was the Sultan of Bacalan and
600 of his followers who occupied a stronghold
on the western side of Lake Lanao from which
they made almost daily forays. Walls of earth
and bamboo some 20 feet in thickness had been
added to the natural defenses of the position
they selected. A moat 40 feet wide and 30 feet
deep surrounded the position. The defenders
thought it was proof against any possible attack.
Friendly overtures failed to make an impression
upon their leaders, and their cotta was
finally surrounded and their surrender demanded.
Still confident of their prowess, they
declined to accede to the American Commander's
demands and the latter was compelled to
assault this strong fortification. Accordingly
trees were felled and used to make a crossing
over the moat and when all was in readiness the
place was taken in a fierce hand-to-hand encounter
between the Americans and the Moros. The
American success was complete and a severe
lesson was taught to Moros in that region. General
Pershing completed the conquest of Mindanao<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Moros by marching his command entirely
around Lake Lanao through the dense jungles
and swamps bordering the lake.</p>

<p>As a matter of interest several reports made
by General Pershing on his work in the Philippines
follow, and some in which reference is
made to him by certain of his superior officers
at that time.</p>

<p>In the later reports sent by Pershing there
is manifest the same painstaking carefulness
and thorough understanding of his task. He
makes recommendations concerning the distribution
of the troops in the Philippines, goes
into detail about the necessity and the location
of cold storage plants, and has positive convictions
as to what changes ought to be made in
the Subsistence Department. Certain posts
also ought to be made permanent. He clearly
presents the reasons leading to his conclusions.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><div class='center'>Annual Report of the Lieutenant General commanding
the Army&mdash;1901</div>

<p>The command left Cagayan, December 16th, under
Major Case, accompanied by Major J. J. Pershing,
adjutant general, department of Mindanao and Jolo.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>In a narrow gorge 800 feet deep formed by the
river the insurgents were found in three strongly
constructed forts which our troops attacked without
loss. The enemy must have suffered severely, but
his loss was not ascertained. Two cannon fell into
our hands. The 18th and 19th of December were
consumed in surrounding the stronghold of Maxajambos
by gaining a position commanding Langaran
to the south of Maxajambos. Langaran, which was
the headquarters of the insurgents, was entered on
the 20th and considerable quantity of provisions,
ammunitions of war, cuartels, etc., were found and
destroyed. The insurrectos had made good their
escape under cover of darkness.</p>

<p>On the 28th, the insurgents were discovered a mile
and a half south of Langaran occupying a strong
position which our troops succeeded in reaching and
the enemy was forced to retreat in disorder. The
command then moved on to Talacao but was not met
by any resistance. Such buildings as had been used
by the insurgents for storehouses, etc., were destroyed
as well as supplies. One prisoner was taken.
The surrounding country was thoroughly scouted
without encountering any enemy force. The troops
returned to Cagayan the 31st of December.</p></div>

<p>From the report of Captain James J. Mays,
40th Infantry, concerning the attack on
Cagayan, December 16th to 25th, 1900:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>He reports, "late in the afternoon of December
17th insurgents concealed in the brush fired on
horses that were being watered in the ca&ntilde;on. Major
Pershing, who was with the command, took fifteen
men on one bluff and I took about the same number
on another and poured volleys into the ca&ntilde;on, firing
at smoke from insurgent pieces, silencing their fire.
I think we killed some of them, but do not know.
The following morning Major Pershing crossed the
river and joined Captain Millar. Captain Millar
threw shells into Maxajambos and signaled that the
place seemed deserted. During the day I kept
patrols on the plateau. Se&ntilde;or Cruz came out on
the morning of this day and I sent him to Captain
Millar. I questioned him about the plan of cutting
through the timber. He said he never heard of anyone
getting through there and that it would be very
difficult on account of the ca&ntilde;on, and also that it
would end on top of a cliff 400 or 500 feet high. I
concluded not to attempt it."</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Subjecting the Moros</span></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first period of General Pershing's service
in the Philippine Islands lasted until 1903.
He then was recalled to the United States and
became a member of the General Staff Corps.
This position he held until 1906.</p>

<p>Within that time, however, he was appointed
the military attach&eacute; at Tokio, Japan, and was
with General Kuroki in the latter's campaign
in the war between Japan and Russia. It is
said that his report forwarded to our Government
is one of the most lucid and forceful
military documents ever received by the Department.</p>

<p>If any discouragements had come to the
young officer in his lonely campaigns in the
jungles of the Philippines and he had felt that
somehow he had been banished to a region
where his services of necessity would never be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
recognized, that thought was banished by the
action of President Roosevelt in 1906.</p>

<p>His services in the First and Fifteenth
Cavalry as well as his activities in Washington
and his report as the military attach&eacute; of his
Government, had brought him very strongly
before the attention of the President, who now
was eager to reward him for his faithful services.</p>

<p>There were certain obstacles, however, in
the way, and the President did his utmost to
secure the proper legislation to enable him to
reward the soldier whom he was eager to
honor. There were delays, however, and the
delays continued. Red tape exerted its binding
force upon the makers of the laws and no
apparent progress was made.</p>

<p>Thereupon President Roosevelt in his direct
way determined to wait no longer for changes
in the laws. Promptly he nominated Pershing
to be Brigadier General; the nomination was
confirmed and the long deferred recognition
was now manifest.</p>

<p>He had labored in somewhat obscure fields.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
He had assisted in subduing insurrections,
had supervised many local improvements in
the territory within which he was working.
He had assisted in winning victories and had
warded off attacks by hostile Moros. There
had, however, been nothing spectacular in his
work. His reliability, good sense, bravery and
administrative ability, however, were now better
known and he was in every way prepared
for the more important problems which now
confronted him.</p>

<p>The President by his action had raised or
"jumped" the new general eight hundred and
sixty-two orders. Worthy as the honor was
and worthily bestowed, for a time there were
protests from disappointed seekers after office.
Some cried "politics," but as a rule these objections
came in loudest tones from those who
by devious ways had sought certain "pulls"
for their own elevation. Personal ambitions
and personal jealousies, perhaps, also entered
to a degree and aided not a little in delaying
the legislation which President Roosevelt
desired.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>Doubtless this condition deeply hurt General
Pershing, but there was no complaining on
his part. It was his to show that he was not
unworthy of his new honor. Years before he had
been taught by his father that to be worthy
of promotion was more than the promotion itself.
And now he was soon to return to the
Philippines to show in the jungle and on the
field, in council and administration, that the
action of the President had not been the result
of idle or thoughtless impulse.</p>

<p>Not long before this time, on January 26,
1905, General Pershing was married. There
is a current story, for the truthfulness of
which the writer cannot vouch, that when the
nomination of Major Pershing for promotion
was placed before the Senate, there was made
at the same time a just and true statement of
the distinguished services he had rendered his
country in his career in the Philippines. In
the visitors' gallery with friends, intently
listening to the proceedings, was Miss Frances
Warren, daughter of United States Senator
Warren of Wyoming. As she listened to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
words spoken concerning the American officer
in the Philippines it is said she remarked,
"What a wonderful record. I should like to
see the man who made it." Not long afterward
she did see him though the meeting was
entirely unexpected. Doubtless the man impressed
her more than had his praises to which
she had listened in the halls of Congress, for
on January 26, 1905, she became Mrs. John
Joseph Pershing.</p>

<p>The general, who for years had been compelled
to live a somewhat lonely life, whose activities
had kept him far from friends and his
own people, was now to have the help and comfort
of the strong and beautiful daughter of Senator
Warren. Never effusive nor one to refer
to his personal or private affairs, his friends
nevertheless have told of the deep love of the
General for his wife and family&mdash;a tragic setting
for the terrible tragedy which later in a
moment disrupted his home and deprived him
forever of his wife and three little daughters.</p>

<p>Directly after the wedding and before the
general and his bride could carry out the plans<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
of a trip they were expecting to make to Japan,
he was abruptly ordered to join the forces of
General Kuroki, as has been said, as the representative
of the Army of the United States
in the war between Japan and Russia. Like
the good soldier that he was there was no complaining,
no expression of his personal disappointment;
he at once obeyed.</p>

<p>For a time General Pershing's work in the
Philippines, to which he soon returned, was not
unlike that in which he formerly had been engaged.</p>

<p>The raids of the Moros on the coast towns
were checked by Pershing's brilliant victory
at Bayan. But the tribe though defeated in
this battle were by no means conquered. They
were obdurate and their long experience with
the Spaniards made them confident of their
ability to hold off the new invading force.</p>

<p>Six hundred hot-headed Moros were ready
to defend their fortress&mdash;the first of forty
similar ones,&mdash;in the crater of an extinct volcano.
The most hot-headed of all was the
leader, the Sultan of Bacolod. Walls of earth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
and bamboo, forty feet in thickness, had been
added to the natural defenses. A moat forty
feet wide and thirty feet deep surrounded the
position. The defenders believed it was proof
against every possible attack.</p>

<p>With five hundred of his own men and an
equal number of selected Filipino scouts
Pershing advanced. The march was difficult
and slow, for in many places the troops were
compelled to cut a pathway through dense
jungles and all the way they were exposed to
sudden and fierce attacks by the fanatical
Moros. But Pershing relentlessly pushed forward
and at last arrived at the foot of the
mountain on which the Moros had confidently
gathered in their supposedly impregnable
stronghold,&mdash;"proof against all attacks."</p>

<p>Not a day was lost. Quietly the leader remarked
that he would "take the place if it
took ten years to capture it"&mdash;a remark that
reminds one of a similar declaration by another
American soldier that he would "fight
it out on this line if it takes all summer."</p>

<p>First, his jungle fighters cut a trail entirely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
around the base of the mountain, at the same
time doing their utmost to protect themselves
against attacks from the Moros who were as
skillful in this work as they were in nearly
every phase of fighting in the jungle. The
men were compelled also to protect themselves
from attacks from above, for it was a favorite
method of the Moros by unexpected attacks,
in rushes of wild fury, to scatter their enemies
when they tried to ascend.</p>

<p>The soldiers speedily formed a complete
cordon around the mountain and the siege
promptly began. Pershing knew what the
Moros did not know that he knew,&mdash;when they
had withdrawn to their stronghold they had
done so in such haste that they neglected or
were unable to bring with them supplies sufficient
for a long siege, and not many days
would pass before the necessity of obtaining
food would compel them to try to break the
iron ring about them and to send out parties
for help.</p>

<p>Pershing's information soon proved to be
correct. After a few days, in small detachments<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
the Moros did their utmost to gain the
open jungle by dashing through the surrounding
lines. But every dash was frustrated, although
the fanatical fighters recklessly threw
themselves into what was certain death. The
failure of one band to break through was
merely a clarion call to others of their fellows
to renew the attempt. The mad and useless
efforts were all baffled.</p>

<p>At last on Christmas Day, 1911, the Moros in
the little fortress did what Moros had not done
before,&mdash;they marched down the mountain side
and surrendered,&mdash;that is, all did save a few
who made a final wild attempt to break through
the jungle. The effort was vain, however, for
the regulars hotly pursued the little brown
fighters and the desperadoes paid the penalty
of their daring.</p>

<p>A second fortress was taken in a similar
manner. But the leader was as wise as he
was brave and determined. After he had
permitted the knowledge of the fall of the first
forts to be carried throughout the tribe, soon
after the beginning of the siege, he sent a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
message within the third fort that the inmates,
if they surrendered, would receive the same
generous treatment the defenders of the other
forts had received.</p>

<p>Soon the brown fighters were convinced and
promptly acted accordingly. They discovered
that they were dealing with a leader different
from any they had previously known. He did
exactly what he said he would do. His promise
could be trusted. His word was reliable; and
forty forts soon were given over to the
Americans.</p>

<p>The subjection of all the Moros, however,
had not yet been accomplished. Some still
distrusted the white men and, as they believed,
fought to retain and defend their homes. At
last, however, at the Battle of Bagsag in June,
1913, the task was completed, though Pershing's
work was not yet all done. What he
had believed to be only a temporary task had
now assumed larger and longer proportions.
He had done so well that he was retained
not only in command but also was the governor
of the newly conquered, but not yet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
friendly province. Perhaps there is no better
proof of the ability and sterling character of
General Pershing anywhere to be found than
the fact that the little brown Moros whom he
defeated and overthrew, later made him a
datto of their tribe&mdash;an official position that
granted him full power of life and death over
every man, woman and child in their numbers
and also made him a judge as well as a ruler
over them.</p>

<p>In his quiet, efficient, modest manner General
Pershing in a larger way had manifested
the same qualities that had marked the lad
at Laclede, the student at West Point, and
the young lieutenant leading his black troops
in Cuba. To-day all Americans are proud as
well as pleased that there were leaders able
to recognize, and brave enough to reward, the
services of a soldier who had filled with honor
every position to which he had been assigned.</p>

<p>In the reports to the War Department there
are many interesting incidents descriptive of
the daring and labors of General Pershing,
who was not only in command of the troops,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
but also, as has been said, the military governor
of the Province of Mindanao. In his
own reports there are general as well as
specific recommendations and the directness
with which he states what to him appear to be
needful for the good of the Filipinos as well
as of the American troops, is marked.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><div class='center'>
[From the Report of June 30, 1910.]<br /></div>
<br />
To the Adjutant-General of the United States Army:<br />


<p>To keep down the lawless element among the
Moros and pagan tribes a relatively large force
must be maintained in this department. We have
now occupied these Islands long enough to determine
quite definitely where such posts should be located.
There should be a regiment post on the Island of
Jolo, a brigade post in the Lake Lanoa division and
the regimental post in some point in the vicinity of
Zamboanga, besides smaller posts at Fort Overton
and Malabang.</p>

<p>Jolo is the strategical site for the post in the Sulu
Archipelago. From there any point in the Island
can be quickly reached and the other islands of
the Sulu group can be easily controlled. It possesses
a good harbor and is otherwise well situated
as a military station. Mounted troops can go anywhere
on the Island and they exert more influence
over the Moros than dismounted troops.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>The Lake Lanoa Moros are turbulent and unruly
and the presence of a relatively large force in that
region will be required for years to come. The
shores of Lake Lanoa afford a very desirable place
for a military post. The country is very fertile and
in case of necessity troops could maintain themselves
there almost indefinitely.</p>

<p>The erection of a permanent post at Zamboanga
is in every way desirable. Troops located at Zamboanga
could be sent to any place in the department
more quickly than from any other point.</p></div>

<p>After stating that many of the barracks and
quarters will not last long, he comments:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Permanent posts should be built entirely of concrete
or of a combination of concrete and most durable
hard woods.</p>

<p>The khaki uniform furnished by the quartermasters'
department for tropical service is poorly
made and ill-fitting. The American made cotton
khaki cloth is heavy, shrinks badly, fades rapidly and
is almost as warm as woolen cloth. This clothing is
as poor an excuse for a military uniform as can be
imagined. Instead of offering inducements to soldiers
to enter and remain in foreign service by
giving them good-looking and well-fitted clothes, we
force upon them these unbecoming, hot, heavy, ill-fitting
uniforms. The best khaki cloth is of English
manufacture and should be prescribed for the army.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
It is light, cool, holds its color and does not shrink.
All uniform cloth ought to be manufactured by
tailors enlisted for the purpose.</p></div>

<p>He goes on to discuss the water supply, public
animals, ships and drydocks, and pack and
wagon transportation, water and sewer systems,
the roads and the works, ice and cold
storage plants and also makes suggestions for
the engineering and ordnance departments.
He asks for the construction, for military purposes,
of a telegraph line of communication
with the District of Davao. He speaks also
of the marked improvement in the target practice,
especially in small arms. He gives the
details of the eighteen expeditions entered
upon and has a complete description of the
Subano uprising, which occurred in November,
1909, among the hill people of Zamboanga.
Certain Moro chiefs from Lake Lanoa, assisted
by pagan and Christian outcasts and
criminals from the Misamis Strip, planned to
gather the hill people into an inaccessible part
of the "Bolman Country." This plan was
carried out by resorting to false prophecies,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
and, in many cases, to violence. Thousands
of these small pastoral Subanos were driven
into camps, where they would be more completely
under the control of these self-appointed
leaders. Large camps were built, one
at Bolman and one at Dampalan, and preparations
were made for defending them. The
positions were well selected. The occupants
were armed with spears, krises, kampilans and
barongs. A constabulary force from Capitan
was sent November 28th, by the Governor of
the Moro provinces, to the outskirts of the
Barbon camp. The Subanos, under the leadership
of their Moro chiefs, attacked the constabulary
with spears, and several of the men
were killed. Upon the call of the Provincial
Governor for troops, the second company of
Philippine scouts, commanded by Captain
Moses T. Barlow, was sent to Dipolog to report
to Major John J. Finley, Governor of the
District of Zamboanga, who was placed in
command.</p>

<p>In the report of Major Finley that officer
writes:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The considerable reward offered for the apprehension
of the leaders did not stimulate the natives
to search for them. The Subanos were thoroughly
subdued and terrorized by the rigorous discipline of
the camp and after the fight of November 28th they
were only too glad to hide themselves in the woods
and mountains. The Philippines made no effort
whatever to earn the reward.</p>

<p>"Ample time was given for the hill people to take
a look at the troops and become convinced that this
form of governmental power was friendly and really
interested in their salvation and prosperity. After
becoming thus convinced, the good influence of the
government spread with rapidity among the Subanos.
They returned to their farms by hundreds daily,
they preferred their services to the government and
declined remuneration. The important witnesses
emerged from their hiding places and the apprehension
of the leaders became a possibility. The leaders
were caught, the witnesses came forward from their
hiding places to convict them, and the wondering
Subanos reclaimed their homes and began life anew.
There was a general rejoicing among them."</p></div>

<p>He reports a shortage of officers and states
that two-year troops hardly get acquainted
with the people or really become interested
in the larger problems that are being worked
out under American control. "The army cannot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
do itself full justice in the administration
of civil affairs in a Moro Province unless the
period of service be extended." He declares
that service in the Philippine Islands is not
more arduous than service in Texas or Arizona.
"There is no reason why enlisted men
should be given credit for double service for
every year spent in the Islands."</p>

<p>He reports also that the Philippine Scouts
are in excellent condition. A high state of discipline
exists among them. Their officers are
enthusiastic and willing, and the same spirit
extends to the men.</p>

<p>In 1911, similar reports are made concerning
uniforms, clothing, etc. The general
good health of the soldiers is described. Only
three cases of typhoid fever occurred in the
entire department. "Too much time is devoted
to target practice in comparison with other
classes of training. The increased pay for expert
riflemen, sharpshooters and marksmen
does not serve to increase appreciation and the
efficiency in rifle fire." He recommended that
extra pay be discontinued.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>He reports nineteen expeditions of the troops
and gives a clear account of the pagan uprising.
He urges an increase in the regular regiments
of infantry in time of peace, to form a
substantial basis in the first line when war
comes. "Under no circumstances should the
enlisted strength of a regiment be less than
one thousand men, in time of peace. In war
this should be increased to two thousand four
hundred or even three thousand." He recommends
that the cavalry regiments be made
smaller. He states that the efficiency of the
cavalry is not as high as it should be, while
the field artillery is below the recognized requirements.
The Philippine Scouts sometimes
are inclined to consider themselves on the same
footing as the white troops, with a consequent
disinclination to perform duties away from
well-equipped and centrally located garrisons.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Considering their low cost of maintenance I believe
it poor policy not to keep them up to the
authorized maximum strength of 12,000, reducing
the garrison of American troops accordingly.</p>

<p>"I believe the time is propitious for the organization<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
of Philippine cavalry, mounted on hardy
native ponies which require none of the expensive
hay of the American horse.</p>

<p>"The post exchange ought to be authorized to sell
beer and light wines. Conducted under proper
regulations and under official supervision this feature
formerly served as a means to furnish soldiers
with a club of their own and save many from the
grog shops and the brothels. The reestablishment
of that part of the exchange would go far to reduce
desertion, venereal diseases and alcoholism among
our troops."</p></div>

<p>In 1914 General Pershing was recalled from
the Philippine Islands.</p>

<p>His work and that of General Funston was
now fully recognized by his countrymen. Peace
had come in the Philippines and the victorious
leaders had been successful not only with their
enemies, but also in winning the confidence of
most of the tribes they conquered. It is said
there was no man in the islands who was more
deeply respected and loved by the natives than
was General Pershing. They were fearful of
him, also, because they knew that he would do
exactly what he said he would do. Strict with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
offenders against the laws, he was at the same
time gentle and friendly to the deserving, and
it was not long before all were aware that he
was working not for conquest or for the glory
of his nation, but to help his country solve one
of the most difficult problems left by the Spanish
War. That problem was to reconstruct and
reorganize the life among the Filipinos in such
a way that they themselves should be helped
and not hurt by the plan. When General Pershing
returned to America, hope was strong
that not many years would elapse before the
little brown men would be able to care for
themselves and be recognized as an independent
nation.</p>

<p>For a brief time he was stationed at the Presidio
in San Francisco, California, but soon
afterward was placed in command of the
southwestern division, along the Mexican border.
It was while he was stationed there in
command of a scant and greatly extended line,
which required constant change on his own
part in order to keep in touch with the various
elements in his command, that the great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
tragedy of the death of his wife and three
little daughters occurred.</p>

<p>On August 27, 1915, while he was in command
at El Paso, word came to him over the telephone
of the awful fire in the Presidio at San
Francisco, where his family, then consisting of
his wife, three little daughters and a little son,
were residing in his enforced absence. Of these,
all except Warren, the little boy, perished in
the fire, a maid having succeeded in rescuing
the little fellow. When the terrible message
was received by the general it is said that at
last he inquired, "Is there anything more to be
told?"</p>

<p>Upon being assured that he now knew not
only the worst but had heard all, he quietly
hung up the receiver and turned away. There
was to be no manifestation of his almost
crushing sorrow. It was his own, and there
we too must leave it. There are few who can
fail to understand. The lines in his strong
face were soon deeper, the graying hair became
lighter still, but General Pershing's suffering
and sorrow were his own, not even to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
be referred to except as one of the facts in
the life of a man who belongs not to himself
alone, but also to his country.</p>

<p>It has been reported that the general requested
that he might be sent on the most
dangerous service to which his country could
assign him. Whether or not he ever made the
request the writer does not know, but that he
might have had such a feeling in his heart can
readily be understood by all. The little
motherless lad, Warren, has been cared for
by the general's sisters, who now reside in
Lincoln, Nebraska.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">In Pursuit of Villa</span></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">General Pershing</span> had been sent to the
Mexican border in command of the Southwestern
Division early in 1915. In command of
the El Paso patrol district, he necessarily was
busy much of his time in guarding and patrolling
the long thin lines of our men on duty
there.</p>

<p>The troubles with Mexico had been steadily
increasing in seriousness. The rivalry and warfare
between various leaders in that country
had not only brought their own country into a
condition of distress, but also had threatened to
involve the United States as well. Citizens of
the latter country had invested large sums in
mining, lumber and other industries in Mexico
and were complaining bitterly of the failure
of our Government either to protect them or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
their investments. Again and again, under
threats of closing their mines or confiscating
their property, they had "bought bonds" of the
rival Mexican parties, which was only another
name for blackmail.</p>

<p>Raids were becoming increasingly prevalent
near the border and already Americans were reported
to have been slain by these irresponsible
bandits who were loyal only to their leaders
and not always to them. The condition was
becoming intolerable.</p>

<p>Germany, too, had her agents busy within the
borders of Mexico, artfully striving not only to
increase her own power in the rich and distracted
country, but also to create and foment
an unreasonable anger against the United
States, vainly hoping in this way to prevent the
latter country from entering the World War
by compelling her to face these threatening
attacks from her neighbor on the south. President
Wilson was doing his utmost to hold a
steady course through the midst of these perils,
which daily were becoming more threatening
and perplexing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>The climax came early in March, 1915, when
Francesco Villa, the most daring and reckless
leader of all the Mexican bandit bands, suddenly
with his followers made an attack on the
post at Columbus, New Mexico. The American
soldiers were taken completely by surprise.
Their machine guns (some said there was only
one at the post) jammed and their defense was
inadequate. They were not prepared. When
Villa withdrew he left nine dead civilians and
eight dead American soldiers behind him.</p>

<p>Instantly the President decided that the time
had come when he must act. There was still
the same strong desire to avoid war with Mexico
if possible. The same suspicion of Germany
was in his mind, but in spite of these things
Villa must be punished and Americans must be
protected. Quickly a call for regulars and State
troops was made and General Pershing was
selected as the leader of the punitive expedition.</p>

<p>The New York <i>Sun</i>, in an editorial at the
time of his selection, said: "At home in the
desert country, familiar with the rules of savage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
warfare, a regular of regulars, sound in
judgment as in physique, a born cavalryman,
John J. Pershing is an ideal commander for the
pursuit into Mexico."</p>

<p>The selection indeed may have been "ideal,"
but the conditions confronting the commander
were far from sharing in that ideal. Equipment
was lacking, many of his men, though
they were brave, were untrained, and, most
perplexing of all, was the exact relation of
Mexico to the United States. There could not
be said to exist a state of war and yet no one
could say the two countries were at peace. He
was invading a hostile country which was not
an enemy, for the raids of bandit bands across
the border did not mean that Mexico as a state
was attacking the United States. He must
move swiftly across deserts and through mountain
fastnesses, he was denied the use of railroads
for transporting either troops or supplies,
enemies were on all sides who were familiar
with every foot of the region and eager to lure
him and his army into traps from which escape
would be well nigh impossible. The fact is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
that for nearly eleven months Pershing maintained
his line, extending nearly four hundred
miles from his base of supplies, in a country
which even if it was not at war was at least
hostile. It is not therefore surprising that
after his return the State of New Mexico voted
a handsome gold medal to the leader of the
punitive expedition for his success in an exceedingly
difficult task.</p>

<p>It was on the morning of March 15, 1916,
when General Pershing dashed across the border
in command of ten thousand United States
cavalrymen, with orders to "get" Villa. A
captain in the Civil War who was in the Battle
of Gettysburg, when he learned of the swift
advance of General Pershing's forces, said:
"The hardest march we ever made was the
advance from Frederick. We made thirty
miles that day between six o'clock <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> and
eleven o'clock <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> But Maryland and Pennsylvania
are not an alkali desert. I have an
idea that twenty-six miles a day, the ground
Pershing was covering on that waterless tramp
in Mexico, was some hiking." And the advance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
is one of the marvels of military achievements
when it is recalled that the march was begun
before either men or supplies, to say nothing
of equipment, were in readiness.</p>

<p>It may have been that it was because of his
better knowledge of these conditions that the
general wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><a name="FNanchor_B_1" id="FNanchor_B_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_1" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>"Our people are not a warlike people and the
average person knows little about our army. The
centers of population have never been brought into
close contact with it, and, like anything that is unfamiliar,
the people entertain a certain prejudice
against it. To overcome this prejudice and to arouse
and maintain an active interest in military preparedness
it will be necessary to adopt some plan
that will bring the army more closely in touch with
the people. The time for this seems opportune and
it can best be done by assigning the various units
of the army to prescribed districts for local recruiting.</p>

<p>"If each regiment or smaller unit were composed
of young men whose families were neighbors, especially
if the home station of that unit were easily
accessible, the people would undoubtedly support the
unit with men and money. Each regimental unit
might be given a local name and there surely would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
be quite as much pride in having a regiment named
for a city or state as in having a war vessel so
named. A regiment recruited locally would start
out with a high <i>esprit de corps</i> and the evil of desertion
would be eliminated. Men now desert mainly
because they have no pride or interest in the individual
organization to which they belong. Localization
would soon develop both. It would also in
time become an easy stepping stone to universal
training to which we must come if we are ever to
hope for a satisfactory solution of our military
problem.</p>



<p>"Universal training does not mean that every man
would have to serve with the army two years or
any other given length of time, but it should mean
that every young man though not drawn to the
colors would have to take a certain amount of military
training. Universal training is a necessary
prerequisite to effective war armies.</p>

<p>"Under a system of compulsory service the whole
number of men to become eligible each year would
be greater than required for active service in the
army, but selections could be easily determined by
lot. Those not drawn for service with the colors
would be given enough training to teach the meaning
of discipline and make them familiar with the
principles of marching, camping and shooting. They
would all be subject to call in case of war and the
question as to whether they were needed at the front
would not be left to the judgment or personal inclination<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
of the individual. The humiliating spectacle
of expending time and effort after war begins
in appealing through the press and platform directly
to the people to support the Government would not
have to be repeated. Each man would expect to do
his part. Men called out for service during the war
require at least a year of drill before they are
familiar with what the modern soldier must know.
The demands of modern warfare upon individuals
are greater than ever before and only the thoroughly
trained and tried soldier is able to stand the strain.
In the Civil War troops were confronted by equally
untrained levies."</p></div>

<p>Behind this calm, clear and deliberate utterance
it is easy to read the unspoken anxiety
and the needless strain forced upon the commander
of the punitive expedition in pursuit of
Villa. And these words were written long before
Pershing ever dreamed he would be the
leader of a mighty host to cross the seas and
in a foreign land fight not only the battles of
his country but also those of humanity as well.</p>

<p>Although the punitive expedition failed in its
main purpose,&mdash;the capture of Villa,&mdash;the
opinion in America was unanimous that the
leadership had been superb. <i>The American</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
<i>Review of Reviews</i> declared that "the expedition
was conducted from first to last in a way
that reflected credit on American arms."</p>

<p>An interesting incident in this chapter of
Pershing's story is that fourteen of the nineteen
Apache Indian scouts whom he had helped
to capture in the pursuit of Geronimo, in 1886,
were aiding him in the pursuit of Villa. Several
of these scouts were past seventy years of
age; indeed, one was more than eighty, but
their keenness on the trail and their long experience
made their assistance of great value.
One of the best was Sharley and another was
Peaches. Several of these Indian scouts are
with the colors in France, still with Pershing.</p>

<p>The main facts in the story of the punitive
expedition are as follows:</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Called to Command the American Expeditionary Forces in France</span></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Meanwhile</span> matters were moving swiftly, the
results of which were to summon General
Pershing to other and far higher duties. The
attitude of Germany was steadily becoming too
unbearable for any self-respecting nation to
endure. War may be the great evil which it
is often called, and doubtless no words can describe
its horrors, but there is one evil even
worse&mdash;for a nation to lose its ideals. The time
for action by the United States had come.</p>

<p>In President Wilson's war message after referring
to the dastardly deeds of Germany he
wrote, "I was for a little while unable to believe
that such things would be done by any government
that had hitherto subscribed to humane
practices of civilized nations," and he refers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
also to the wanton and wholesale destruction
of the lives of noncombatants&mdash;men, women
and children&mdash;engaged in pursuits "which have
always, even in the darkest periods of modern
history, been deemed innocent and legitimate."</p>

<p>In spite of the Teutonic claim of a higher
"kultur" than other nations and the loudly
expressed desires for the "freedom of the
seas," Germany's brutal disregard of the
rights of neutrals had extended far beyond the
confines of Belgium, which she ruthlessly invaded
and ravaged.</p>

<p>On the sea her former promises were like her
treaty with Belgium&mdash;"scraps of paper."</p>

<p>And the President had now behind him not
merely the sentiment of his people, but also
specific examples to uphold him. For instance,
Admiral Sampson in the war with Spain, had
appeared May 12, 1898, with his fleet before
Santiago, Cuba. There he conducted a <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'reconnoissance'">reconnaissance</ins>
in force in his efforts to locate the
Spanish fleet, of which Admiral Cervera was in
command. Sampson, however, did not bombard
the city, because, in accordance with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
accepted laws of nations, he would have been
required to give due notice of his intention in
order that the sick, women, children and non-combatants
might be removed. And yet everyone
knew that a hard, quick bombardment of
Santiago would have given him the city. He
attacked the forts only, and before a gun was
fired gave his ships' captains word that they
were to avoid hitting the Spanish Military
Hospital.</p>

<p>Even in the general orders of the German
Admiralty staff (Berlin, June 22, 1914) was
the following direction, after stating that the
passengers of every armed captured merchant
vessel were to be left to go free "unless it appears
they have participated in the resistance":
"Before proceeding to the destruction of the
(neutral) vessel (which has been seized for
proper reason), the safety of all persons on
board, and, so far as possible their effects, is
to be provided for."</p>

<p>President Wilson, at first unable to believe
that Germany was deliberately violating her
word and even after it was impossible to avoid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
the conclusion that the campaign of the Teutons
was being conducted, to use their own expression,
"ruthlessly," still was doing his utmost
to keep the United States out of the World
War. For this he was bitterly assailed and
criticised. However, he patiently held to his
policy announced a year before, that he would
"wait until facts become unmistakable and
even susceptible of only one interpretation."</p>

<p>As early as December 24, 1914, Admiral Von
Tirpitz in numerous inspired newspaper articles
and interviews, began to explain the possibility
of a very decided change in the German U-boat
campaign. This too was before Germany was
really suffering in any marked degree from the
tightening work of the British navy. In spite
of his arrogant words, however, the German
admiral directly asks, "What will America
say?"</p>

<p>On February 4, 1915, the Germans in a way
that was outside all international law, publicly
declared that 'within certain expressed limits
of the sea or war zone, their U-boats would sink
vessels without warning found there without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
permission, or if they were engaged in dealings
with the enemy.'</p>

<p>Six days later President Wilson warned Germany
that she will be held to "strict accountability"
if the rights of American vessels within
the proscribed limits are violated.</p>

<p>It was April 22, 1915, when, through the
acknowledged direction of the German Embassy,
advertisements appeared in New York
papers warning all against sailing on vessels
planning to pass through the war zone. And
this was done in the face of the President's
words and the correspondence that had been
carried on between the two countries.</p>

<p>The <i>Lusitania</i> was sunk May 7, 1915. A
thousand lives were lost, many of them Americans.
A roar of anger rose from America and
the civilized world at the brutality of this act,
as well as at the dastardly disregard of the
rights of neutral nations. "They were
warned," said the Germans glibly, as if their
"warning" was sufficient. For a nation that
had made huge profits in selling munitions at
other times to warring peoples their "warning"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
would have been ridiculous had it not
been tragic. The commander of the U-boat received
a German medal for his "gallantry" in
sinking the <i>Lusitania</i> and sending hundreds of
innocent victims to their watery graves. As
if to add insult to injury Germany proclaimed
a holiday for her schools on the occasion.</p>

<p>President Wilson still held to his patient
course. He would give Germany every opportunity
to explain the act before he himself
acted. May 13, 1915, his first so-called "<i>Lusitania</i>
letter" was written. Germany replied
May 28th, declaring that she was justified in
sinking the great vessel. On June 9th, the
President sent his "second <i>Lusitania</i> letter,"
and correspondence followed which plainly indicated
that Germany was trying to evade the
real issue.</p>

<p>July 31, 1915, saw the "third <i>Lusitania</i> letter,"
for even then the President was doing his
utmost to avoid war, if avoidance was possible.
On August 19, 1915, the <i>Arabic</i> was torpedoed
by a U-boat and still other Americans lost
their lives. The German ambassador to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
United States, Count von Bernstorff, however,
apparently thought to stave off action by pledging
(orally) for his country that her submarines
would not sink "liners" without warning.</p>

<p>The ambassador's words were not unlike
those previously received, for instead of the
matter being settled, still more unsatisfactory
correspondence followed and other boats also
were sent to the bottom of the sea.</p>

<p>The following February, Germany made certain
proposals that had an appearance of a
grudging or compulsory willingness on her part
to provide for the <i>Lusitania</i> victims, but within
a few days (March 24, 1916), another passenger
steamer, the <i>Sussex</i>, was torpedoed, and among
the lost were Americans.</p>

<p>The feeling in Washington was becoming
tense and was still more intensified in April,
when Germany sneeringly explained that she
was not positive whether or not she sank the
<i>Sussex</i>. She did admit, however, that one of
her submarines had been in action near the
place where the <i>Sussex</i> was sent to the bottom.</p>

<p>Eight days later President Wilson threatened<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Germany that he would break off diplomatic
relations if similar acts recurred. Perhaps because
she was biding her time Germany on May
4th gave a "promise" that no more ships
should be sunk without warning.</p>

<p>In October of that same year (1916) a German
submarine appeared off the New England coast.
Her officers put into Newport and it is said
were even graciously received and most courteously
treated. Then, in return for the hospitality
thus received, the submarine sank the
<i>Stephano</i>, which had a large body of Americans
on board returning from a vacation spent in
Newfoundland. Without doubt many would have
been lost if American men-of-war had not been
at hand to rescue the victims from the water.
Still, apparently there was not even a thought
in the minds of Germany's rulers, that they had
violated any rules of decency, to say nothing
of rules of right.</p>

<p>The patience of the United States was near
the breaking point when still the dastardly
deeds did not cease, and few were surprised
when at last, January 31, 1917, Germany discovered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
that deceit no longer was possible and
that the patience and hope of America could no
longer be abused. On that date the German
leaders came out openly and informed the President
that they planned to "begin an unrestricted
submarine war." Three days afterward
President Wilson gave the German ambassador
to the United States his passports
and recalled the American ambassador (Gerard)
from Berlin.</p>

<p>Such evasion and hypocrisy, such wanton
brutality and cruelty as had been displayed by
Germany were without parallel in history&mdash;or
at least since the history of civilization began.
Naturally a declaration of war by the United
States was the only possible outcome.</p>

<p>The unlawful sinking of American vessels or
of other vessels having Americans on board
makes up a list that is striking when it is looked
at as a whole and it is recalled that they had
been sunk after Germany had "ruthlessly"
repudiated the pledges she had given.</p>

</table></div>

<p>Perhaps in this list should also be included
the sinking of the <i>William P. Frye</i>, January
28, 1915, by the German raider, <i>Prinz Eitel
Friedrich</i>. The very acme of impudence
seems to have been reached when this raider,
after having unlawfully sunk American vessels,
sought refuge in the American port of Newport
News, Virginia. No clearer testimony has ever
been given of the state of mind among the Germans,
unless it is the actions of the German
crew of this vessel after they had been interned.</p>

<p>Preceding the declaration of war by the
United States, two hundred and twenty-six of
her citizens had lost their lives by the unlawful
acts of German submarines. Among those who
perished in this manner were many women and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
children. In nearly every instance there was
not even the form of an excuse that Germany
was acting in accord with the laws of nations.
Outside the American vessels the
official estimate made at that time by the
Government of the United States was that
six hundred and sixty-eight vessels of neutral
nations had been sunk by the piratical
German submarines. It appeared almost as
if the rulers of Germany either were insane
or were so bent on their wild dreams of
subduing the world to their will that they deliberately
said to themselves, "evil, be thou
our good." They had thrown down the gauntlet
to the civilized parts of the entire world.
Even after Brazil, China, Bolivia, Guatemala
and other nations broke off diplomatic relations
with Germany and almost all the civilized nations
of the earth had protested against the
brutal policy boldly followed by her, she whiningly
complained that the world was jealous of
her greatness and had combined to overthrow
the "kultur" she was so eager to share with all
mankind.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>In addition to the frightfulness of Germany
on the seas (a term she herself had invented
and blatantly advocated), the activity of German
spies and the dangerous "propaganda"
she was putting forth in the United States were
even more insulting and quite as threatening
to American lives and property as was her
dastardly work with her submarines. Many of
the intrigues were not made known by the Government
of the United States.</p>

<p>When the message of President Wilson was
presented, the committee on Foreign Affairs in
the House of Representatives went on formal
record, after presenting its resolution declaring
a state of war to exist between the United
States and Germany, that within our country
at least twenty-one crimes or "unfriendly"
acts had been committed either by the direction
of or connivance with the Imperial German
Government. And nearly every one of
these unfriendly acts in itself was a sufficient
basis for war. Included in this list were the
following clearly known facts:</p>

<p>An office had been maintained in the United<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
States to issue fraudulent passports for German
reservists. This work was under the
direction of Captain von Papen, who was a
member of the German Embassy.</p>

<p>German spies were sent to England who
were supplied with passports from the United
States.</p>

<p>In defiance of our laws steamers had been
sent from our ports with supplies for German
sea raiders.</p>

<p>Hindus within the United States had been
supplied with money by Germany to stir up
revolutions and revolts in India.</p>

<p>A German agent had been sent from the
United States to blow up with dynamite the international
bridge at Vanceboro, Maine.</p>

<p>Germany had provided funds for her agents
in the United States to blow up factories in
Canada.</p>

<p>Five distinct conspiracies had been unearthed,
in which Germany was the guiding
spirit, to make and place bombs on ships leaving
ports of the United States. Several of
those conspiracies were successful and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
murderous bombs were placed even on board
vessels of the United States. She was working
to arouse and increase a feeling of bitterness
in Mexico against the United States. In
this way it was hoped by Germany that we
would be drawn into war with Mexico, and
thereby be prevented from entering into either
the Great War or European affairs.</p>

<p>Providing huge sums of money to be used
in bribing newspapers in the United States to
publish articles which should prevent America
from entering the war and arouse a feeling of
bitterness against England and France. Later
it was admitted by German agents that a plan
had been formed by which forty leading American
newspapers were to be purchased and used
for this purpose. The plan was not wholly successful,
but many papers or certain editors
were proved to have been bought with this end
in view and some fully earned their money.</p>

<p>Insult was added to injury. Such colossal
brutality was even commended and upheld by
the friends of Germany and defended on the
ground that the "fatherland" had been attacked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
treacherously and therefore was entitled,
whether or not she was acting in accord
with established and accepted laws, to which
she had given her approval, to defend herself
in every possible way.</p>

<p>Perhaps the climax of this outrageous disregard
of decency came when Secretary Lansing
exposed March 1, 1917, the infamous
"Zimmerman note." It was written before
war had been declared, and, officially at least,
Germany and the United States were friends
at the time. Indeed it was only three days
after the appearance of President Wilson before
the Senate with his plan for a league of
nations to secure and assure justice and peace
for all nations. This infamous note was even
brought to the United States and was to be
carried across the border into Mexico, a country
with which we were not at war and with
which the President was doing his utmost to
maintain peace.</p>

<p>It is impossible to give the entire message
but the following extracts will reveal its character:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><div class='right'>
"Berlin, January 19, 1917.<br />
</div>

<p>"On February 1 we intend to begin submarine
war unrestricted. In spite of this it is our intention
to keep neutral the United States of America.</p>

<p>"If this attempt is not successful we propose an
alliance on the following basis with Mexico,&mdash;That
we shall make war together and together make peace.
We shall give general financial support and it is
understood that Mexico is to reconquer the lost territory
in New Mexico, Texas and Arizona. The details
are left to you for settlement."</p></div>

<p>The German Secretary then goes on to instruct
the German Minister in Mexico to open
secret negotiations with Carranza just as soon
as it is plain that the proposed U-boat campaign
brings the United States into the war
and also to get Carranza to draw Japan into
the proposed war against us.</p>

<p>Just how the Government obtained this note
will not be known until an explanation is given
later, but its authorized publication by Secretary
Lansing instantly aroused an intense feeling
of anger throughout the country. For a
"friendly" nation to be plotting against a
"friend," to attempt to use that nation even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
then as a base of operations against its peace
and security, to say nothing of the plan to induce
still another friendly power to attack us,
outraged our every sense of decency and justice.
A cry of anger and dismay was heard on
every side&mdash;except perhaps from certain pro-Germans
who weakly protested that "the letter
was a palpable forgery, too apparent to be
read under any other supposition than that
the German Secretary never wrote such a piece
of work."</p>

<p>The dismay of these friends of Germany can
only be imagined when Secretary Zimmerman
boldly acknowledged that he had written the
letter. He even defended himself in doing so.
As if that were not sufficient, he proceeded to
complain because the United States had intercepted
the letter, for the Mexican President
had quickly declared his ignorance of any such
message. It is difficult to say whether the calm
assurance of Zimmerman that he was the
writer or his childish whining that the United
States had no right to intercept even such
treacherous messages if they chanced to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
written by Germany, produced the greater consternation.
The inability of Germany to comprehend
why any nation should object to anything
Germany wanted to do or say was itself
beyond the ability of a civilized people to understand.
It was perhaps the most sublime
impudence the world ever has witnessed.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Why America Went to War with Germany</span></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">A state</span> of war had been declared April 5,
1917, to exist between the United States and
the Imperial German Government. There is
no clearer or more forceful statement of the
reason why we went to war than the address
delivered by President Wilson at Washington
on Flag Day, June 14, 1917:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">My Fellow-Citizens</span>: We meet to celebrate Flag
Day because this flag which we honor and under
which we serve is the emblem of our unity, our
power, our thought and purpose as a nation. It
has no other character than that which we give it
from generation to generation. The choices are ours.
It floats in majestic silence above the hosts that execute
those choices, whether in peace or in war. And
yet, though silent, it speaks to us&mdash;speaks to us of
the past, of the men and women who went before
us and of the records they wrote upon it. We celebrate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
the day of its birth; and from its birth until
now it has witnessed a great history, has floated on
high the symbol of great events, of a great plan of
life worked out by a great people. We are about
to carry it into battle, to lift it where it will draw
the fire of our enemies. We are about to bid thousands,
hundreds of thousands, it may be millions, of
our men, the young, the strong, the capable men of
the nation, to go forth and die beneath it on fields
of blood far away&mdash;for what? For some unaccustomed
thing? For something for which it has never
sought the fire before? American armies were never
before sent across the seas. Why are they sent now?
For some new purpose, for which this great flag
has never been carried before, or for some old,
familiar, heroic purpose for which it has seen men,
its own men, die on every battlefield upon which
Americans have borne arms since the Revolution?</p>

<p>These are questions which must be answered. We
are Americans. We in our turn serve America, and
can serve her with no private purpose. We must
use her flag as she has always used it. We are accountable
at the bar of history and must plead in
utter frankness what purpose it is we seek to serve.</p>


<div class='center'><br />FORCED INTO WAR</div>

<p>It is plain enough how we were forced into the war.
The extraordinary insults and aggressions of the
Imperial German Government left us no self-respecting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
choice but to take up arms in defense of our
rights as a free people and of our honor as a
sovereign Government. The military masters of
Germany denied us the right to be neutral. They
filled our unsuspecting communities with vicious
spies and conspirators and sought to corrupt the
opinion of our people in their own behalf. When
they found that they could not do that, their agents
diligently spread sedition among us and sought to
draw our own citizens from their allegiance&mdash;and
some of those agents were men connected with the
official embassy of the German Government itself
here in our own capital. They sought by violence
to destroy our industries and arrest our commerce.
They tried to incite Mexico to take up arms against
us and to draw Japan into a hostile alliance with
her&mdash;and that, not by indirection, but by direct suggestion
from the Foreign Office in Berlin. They
impudently denied us the use of the high seas and
repeatedly executed their threat that they would
send to their death any of our people who ventured
to approach the coasts of Europe. And many of
our own people were corrupted. Men began to look
upon their own neighbors with suspicion and to wonder
in their hot resentment and surprise whether
there was any community in which hostile intrigue
did not lurk. What great nation in such circumstances
would not have taken up arms? Much as
we had desired peace, it was denied us, and not of
our own choice. This flag under which we serve<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
would have been dishonored had we withheld our
hand.</p>

<p>But that is only part of the story. We know now
as clearly as we knew before we were ourselves engaged
that we are not the enemies of the German
people and that they are not our enemies. They did
not originate or desire this hideous war or wish that
we should be drawn into it; and we are vaguely
conscious that we are fighting their cause, as they
will some day see it, as well as our own. They are
themselves in the grip of the same sinister power
that has now at last stretched its ugly talons out
and drawn blood from us. The whole world is at
war because the whole world is in the grip of that
power and is trying out the great battle which shall
determine whether it is to be brought under its
mastery or fling itself free.</p>


<div class='center'><br />THE MASTERS OF GERMANY</div>

<p>The war was begun by the military masters of
Germany, who proved to be also the masters of
Austria-Hungary. These men have never regarded
nations as peoples, men, women, and children of like
blood and frame as themselves, for whom Governments
existed and in whom Governments had their
life. They have regarded them merely as serviceable
organizations which they could by force or intrigue
bend or corrupt to their own purpose. They
have regarded the smaller States, in particular, and
the peoples who could be overwhelmed by force as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
their natural tools and instruments of domination.
Their purpose has long been avowed. The statesmen
of other nations, to whom that purpose was
incredible, paid little attention; regarded what German
professors expounded in their classrooms and
German writers set forth to the world as the goal
of German policy, as rather the dream of minds detached
from practical affairs, as preposterous private
conceptions of German destiny, than as the actual
plans of responsible rulers; but the rulers of Germany
themselves knew all the while what concrete
plans, what well-advanced intrigues lay back of what
the professors and the writers were saying, and were
glad to go forward unmolested, filling the thrones
of Balkan States with German Princes, putting
German officers at the service of Turkey to drill
her armies and make interest with her Government,
developing plans of sedition and rebellion in India
and Egypt, setting their fires in Persia. The demands
made by Austria upon Serbia were a mere
single step in a plan which compassed Europe and
Asia, from Berlin to Bagdad. They hoped those demands
might not arouse Europe, but they meant to
press them whether they did or not, for they thought
themselves ready for the final issue of arms.</p>


<div class='center'><br />A TOOL OF GERMANY</div>

<p>Their plan was to throw a broad belt of German
military power and political control across the very
center of Europe and beyond the Mediterranean into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
the heart of Asia; and Austria-Hungary was to be
as much their tool and pawn as Serbia or Bulgaria
or Turkey or the ponderous States of the East.
Austria-Hungary, indeed, was to become part of the
Central German Empire, absorbed and dominated by
the same forces and influences that had originally
cemented the German States themselves. The dream
had its heart at Berlin. It could have had a heart
nowhere else! It rejected the idea of solidarity of
race entirely. The choice of peoples played no part
in it at all. It contemplated binding together racial
and political units which could be kept together only
by force&mdash;Czechs, Magyars, Croats, Serbs, Rumanians,
Turks, Armenians&mdash;the proud States of Bohemia
and Hungary, the stout little commonwealths
of the Balkans, the indomitable Turks, the subtle
peoples of the East. These peoples did not wish to
be united. They ardently desired to direct their
own affairs, would be satisfied only by undisputed
independence. They could be kept quiet only by
the presence of the constant threat of armed men.
They would live under a common power only by
sheer compulsion and await the day of revolution.
But the German military statesmen had reckoned
with all that and were ready to deal with it in their
own way.</p>


<div class='center'><br />THE PRESENT CONDITION</div>

<p>And they have actually carried the greater part
of that amazing plan into execution. Look how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
things stand. Austria is at their mercy. It has
acted, not upon its own initiative nor upon the choice
of its own people, but at Berlin's dictation ever
since the war began. Its people now desire peace,
but cannot have it until leave is granted from Berlin.
The so-called Central Powers are in fact but a single
power. Serbia is at its mercy, should its hands be
but for a moment freed; Bulgaria has consented to
its will and Rumania is overrun. The Turkish
armies, which Germans trained, are serving Germany,
certainly not themselves, and the guns of German
warships lying in the harbor at Constantinople remind
Turkish statesmen every day that they have
no choice but to take their orders from Berlin.
From Hamburg to the Persian Gulf the net is spread.</p>


<div class='center'><br />A FALSE CRY FOR PEACE</div>

<p>Is it not easy to understand the eagerness for
peace that has been manifested from Berlin ever
since the snare was set and sprung? Peace, peace,
peace has been the talk of her Foreign Office now
for a year or more; not peace upon her own initiative,
but upon the initiative of the nations over which
she now deems herself to hold the advantage. A
little of the talk has been public, but most of it has
been private. Through all sorts of channels it has
come to me, and in all sorts of guises, but never
with the terms disclosed which the German Government
would be willing to accept. That Government<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
has other valuable pawns in its hands besides those
I have mentioned. It still holds a valuable part of
France, though with slowly relaxing grasp, and practically
the whole of Belgium. Its armies press close
upon Russia and overrun Poland at their will. It
cannot go further; it dare not go back. It wishes to
close its bargain before it is too late, and it has little
left to offer for the pound of flesh it will demand.</p>

<p>The military masters under whom Germany is
bleeding see very clearly to what point fate has
brought them. If they fall back or are forced back
an inch their power both abroad and at home will
fall to pieces like a house of cards. It is their power
at home they are thinking about now more than their
power abroad. It is that power which is trembling
under their very feet; and deep fear has entered
their hearts. They have but one chance to perpetuate
their military power or even their controlling political
influence. If they can secure peace now with
the immense advantages still in their hands, which
they have up to this point apparently gained, they
will have justified themselves before the German
people; they will have gained by force what they
promised to gain by it&mdash;an immense expansion of
German power, an immense enlargement of German
industrial and commercial opportunities. Their
prestige will be secure, and with their prestige their
political power. If they fail, their people will thrust
them aside; a Government accountable to the people
themselves will be set up in Germany as it has been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
in England, in the United States, in France, and in
all the great countries of the modern time except
Germany. If they succeed they are safe and Germany
and the world are undone; if they fail Germany
is saved and the world will be at peace. If
they succeed America will fall within the menace.
We and all the rest of the world must remain armed,
as they will remain, and must make ready for the
next step in their aggression; if they fail the world
may unite for peace and Germany may be of the
union.</p>

<p>Do you not now understand the new intrigue, the
intrigue for peace, and why the masters of Germany
do not hesitate to use any agency that promises to
effect their purpose, the deception of the nations?
Their present particular aim is to deceive all those
who throughout the world stand for the rights of
peoples and the self-government of nations; for they
see what immense strength the forces of justice and
of liberalism are gathering out of this war.</p>


<div class='center'><br />PROPAGANDA</div>

<p>They are employing liberals in their enterprise.
They are using men, in Germany and without, as
their spokesmen whom they have hitherto despised
and oppressed, using them for their own destruction&mdash;Socialists,
the leaders of labor, the thinkers they
have hitherto sought to silence. Let them once succeed
and these men, now their tools, will be ground
to powder beneath the weight of the great military<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
empire they will have set up; the revolutionists in
Russia will be cut off from all succor or <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'cooperation'">co&ouml;peration</ins>
in Western Europe and a counter-revolution fostered
and supported; Germany herself will lose her chance
of freedom, and all Europe will arm for the next, the
final, struggle.</p>

<p>The sinister intrigue is being no less actively conducted
in this country than in Russia and in every
country in Europe to which the agents and dupes
of the Imperial German Government can get access.
That Government has many spokesmen here, in
places high and low. They have learned discretion.
They keep within the law. It is opinion they utter
now, not sedition. They proclaim the liberal purposes
of their masters; declare this a foreign war
which can touch America with no danger to either
her lands or her institutions; set England at the
center of the stage and talk of her ambition to assert
economic dominion throughout the world; appeal to
our ancient tradition of isolation in the politics of
the nations, and seek to undermine the Government
with false professions of loyalty to its principles.</p>

<p>But they will make no headway. The false betray
themselves always in every accent. It is only friends
and partisans of the German Government whom we
have already identified who utter these thinly disguised
disloyalties. The facts are patent to all the
world, and nowhere are they more plainly seen than
in the United States, where we are accustomed to
deal with facts and not with sophistries; and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
great fact that stands out above all the rest is that
this is a people's war, a war for freedom and justice
and self-government among all the nations of the
world, a war to make the world safe for the peoples
who live upon it and have made it their own, the
German people themselves included; and that with
us rests the choice to break through all these hypocrisies
and patent cheats and masks of brute force
and help set the world free, or else stand aside and
let it be dominated a long age through by sheer
weight of arms and the arbitrary choices of self-constituted
masters, by the nation which can maintain
the biggest armies and the most irresistible
armaments&mdash;a power to which the world has afforded
no parallel and in the face of which political freedom
must wither and perish.</p>

<p>For us there is but one choice. We have made it.
Woe be to the man or group of men that seeks to
stand in our way in this day of high resolution when
every principle we hold dearest is to be vindicated
and made secure for the salvation of the nations.
We are ready to plead at the bar of history, and our
flag shall wear a new luster. Once more we shall
make good with our lives and fortunes the great
faith to which we were born, and a new glory shall
shine in the face of our people.</p></div>

<p>The war was now on. All the latent power
of the nation of every kind was to be used in
every way to help drive the German menace<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
from the world. A visit to the new world by
Marshal Joffre, Viviani, Lord Asquith and
others helped to accelerate matters. No one
will know until the war is ended just what took
place in the councils between these great men
of the old world and the leaders of the new.</p>

<p>Everyone does know, however, the instantaneous
activity and enthusiasm which seized
with compelling force upon the people of the
United States.</p>

<p>But there must be a military leader. What
was more natural than that the choice should
fall upon General John Joseph Pershing? General
Funston had died suddenly at San Antonio,
Texas, and there was no one now to outrank
the leader of the punitive expedition into
Mexico.</p>

<p>So General Pershing was selected. The man
who had feared he was to be ignored and left
forgotten in the jungles of the Philippines was
now to be the Commander of the American Expeditionary
Force in France. Promotion once
more had come to the man who had sought
first to be worthy to be promoted.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">In England and France</span></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">On</span> June 8, 1917, General Pershing with his
staff arrived (on the White Star Liner, <i>Baltic</i>),
at Liverpool. There was keen excitement in
the busy city and a warm welcome for the
military representative of the great republic
which now was one of the Allies. Accompanied
by a guard of honor and a military band which
was playing the Star Spangled Banner, a
British general was waiting to pay due honor
to the arriving military leader. The British
admiral in command at Liverpool was also
present to greet the arriving General, as was
also the Lord Mayor of the city. The docks
and shops, the houses and parks were filled
with a waiting, eager throng that was quiet in
its deep, tense feeling.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>To the British public General Pershing gave
out the following message:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"We are very proud and glad to be the standard
bearers of our country in this great war for civilization
and to land on British soil. The welcome which
we have received is magnificent and deeply appreciated.
We hope in time to be playing our part&mdash;and
we hope it will be a big part&mdash;on the western
front."</p></div>

<p>As soon as the American Commander had
been suitably greeted he started for London
by special train. The official state car had been
attached to the train for the General's benefit.
In his swift ride through the many busy cities
which remind one more of American cities
than does any other part of England, through
the beautiful and carefully cultivated rural
regions, past Oxford with its crowning towers,
many hoary with age, the party was taken. It
is only natural to conjecture what thoughts
must have been in the mind of the General at
the time. Was he thinking of Laclede and the
negro school which he had taught? Or of his
modestly brave work in Cuba and the Philippines?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
Or did the statement he had made to
a friend years before when he started for
West Point that "war was no more and a gun
would not be fired in a hundred years," again
come back to him, when, seated in the car of
state, he was swept swiftly toward London on
that beautiful and historic day in June?</p>

<p>In London, United States Ambassador Page,
Admiral Sims of the United States Navy, Lord
Derby, British Secretary of State for War,
General Lord French and many other leaders
of the British Army were waiting to receive
him. Throngs of people on every side were
doing their utmost to show that they too as
well as the representatives of their Government,
wanted to manifest their appreciation in
every possible way of the coming of the Commander
of the American Expeditionary Force.</p>

<p>The following day General Pershing was presented
formally to King George V at Buckingham
Palace. General Lord Brooke, commander
of the Twelfth Canadian Infantry
Brigade, as was most fitting, was the spokesman.
To General Pershing the King said:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It has been the dream of my life to see the two
great English-speaking nations more closely united.
My dreams have been realized. It is with the utmost
pleasure that I welcome you, at the head of the American
contingent, to our shores."</p></div>

<p>His Majesty conversed informally with each
member of the General's staff and talked with
the General a longer time. His intense interest
and enthusiasm as well as his gratitude
were manifest not only in his spoken words
but also in the cordial grasp of his hand when
they departed. It was the representative of
one great nation trying to express his appreciation
to the representative of another nation.</p>

<p>There were numerous formal calls and entertainments
to follow and on June 11th, when
these all had been duly done, General Pershing
and Ambassador Page were entertained at
luncheon by King George and Queen Mary, who
personally showed their guests through the historic
rooms and beautiful grounds of the
palace. It was not merely a meeting of the
English king and the American soldier&mdash;it
was the quiet manifestation of the deep feeling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
and strong ties that now bound together
the two great peoples they represented.</p>

<p>General Pershing then departed for the War
Office where already members of his staff had
been busily conferring with the corresponding
members of the British Army.</p>

<p>In the afternoon of that busy day General
Pershing was taken as a visitor to the House
of Commons. In the Distinguished Visitors
Gallery he sat watching the scene before him
though he himself in reality was the observed
of all the observers, as perhaps he was made
aware a little later when as a guest of the
members he "took tea" on the Terrace.</p>

<p>In the evening he was the guest of Ambassador
Page at dinner when among others he
met Premier Lloyd George, Arthur J. Balfour,
Lord Derby, Lord Robert Cecil, Viscount
French, Admiral Sir John Jellicoe, Vice-Admiral
William S. Sims, U. S. N., and General
Jan Smuts. It may all have been a part of the
formal reception of a welcome visitor, but it
also was more, for in this way England and
America were doing their utmost to express to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
the world the cordial relations existing between
the two great nations now banded together
to fight a common foe.</p>

<p>There are many formalities which have
grown to be a part of the reception of the
representative of a foreign power by the country
which receives him. In a democratic land,
like the United States these may appear to be
somewhat exaggerated, but they have also become
the expression of the desire to honor the
land from which the visitor comes and consequently
cannot be ignored. Shaking hands
as an expression of personal regard is doubtless
a somewhat meaningless conventionality,
but the man who refuses to shake hands is
looked upon as a boor. Doubtless General
Pershing, whatever his simpler tastes might
have dictated, was well aware that behind all
the formal display was the deep-seated desire
to honor the country whose personal representative
he was.</p>

<p>After a visit to a training camp to witness
the British method of training for fighting in
the trenches, he was the guest at a luncheon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
of Lord Derby, the British Secretary of State
for War. Although the day had been strenuous,
nevertheless in the evening he and eighteen
members of his staff were the guests of
the British Government at a formal war-dinner.
This dinner was served at Lancaster
House, a beautiful building which the Government
uses solely for state entertainment of
distinguished visitors from abroad. Eight
members of the British Cabinet were among
the thirty present. The dinner was served in
the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'magnificiently'">magnificently</ins> furnished dining-hall. The
guests were seated at six round tables, each
presided over by one of the distinguished men
of Great Britain, the Prime Minister sitting at
the head of the first table and Lord Curzon,
Lord President of the Council; the Right Honorable
George M. Barnes, Pensions Minister;
Viscount Milner, member of the War Cabinet;
Earl of Derby, Secretary for War and Sir
Alfred Mond, presiding at the others.</p>

<p>The four days of formal welcome in England
were at last ended and General Pershing and
his staff sailed for France where the military<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
activities of the United States were to be made
a part of the common purpose to turn Germany
back from her designs.</p>

<p>In France, too, although she is not a kingdom,
there were to be certain formal ceremonies
of recognition. The French people are
somewhat more demonstrative than the English,
but behind it all was the common enthusiasm
over the entrance of America into the
Great War.</p>

<p>Of General Pershing's reception at Boulogne
we have already learned.<a name="FNanchor_C_1" id="FNanchor_C_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_1" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> Before he departed
for Paris, however, he said to the reporters of
the French newspapers, whom he received in
the private car which the French Government
had provided for his use: "The reception we
have received is of great significance. It has
impressed us greatly. It means that from the
present moment our aims are the same."</p>

<p>To the representatives of the American
press, whom he welcomed after he had received
the French, he said: "America has entered
this war with the fullest intention of doing her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
share, no matter how great or how small that
share may be. Our allies can depend on that."</p>


<p>Great crowds of enthusiastic people from
streets, walls, windows and housetops greeted
the American General when the train that was
bringing him entered the Gare du Nord at
Paris. Cordons of "blue devils" were on the
platforms of the station and dense lines of
troops patrolled the streets and guarded adjacent
blocks as the party was escorted to the
Place de la Concorde, where General Pershing
was to make his temporary headquarters at
the Hotel de Crillon.</p>

<p>Bands were playing the Star Spangled Banner
and the Marseillaise, the flag of the United
States was waving in thousands of hands and
displayed from almost every building, while a
steady shout like the roar of the ocean, "Vive
l'Amerique!" greeted the party as the automobiles
in which they were riding advanced
along the densely packed streets. It is said
that General Pershing was "visibly affected"
by the ovation into which his welcome had been
turned. What a contrast it all was to the life<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
and work in the jungles of the Philippines
where the young officer had perhaps feared he
had been left and forgotten. And yet it was
the faithful, persistent, honest work done for
the little brown Moro people which helped to
make the present occasion possible.</p>

<p>In the evening of that day (June 13th)
American Ambassador Sharp gave a dinner
in honor of the coming of General Pershing.
At this dinner the chief officers of the French
army and navy were present. Indeed in the
brief time before General Pershing was to
assume his active duties it almost seemed as
if the desire of the French Government and
the French people to do honor to the American
commander would test his powers of endurance
to the uttermost. There were several
events, however, that stand out in the foreground
of those remarkable days.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">At the Tomb of Napoleon</span></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of these notable events was the visit of
General Pershing to the Hotel des Invalides in
which is the tomb of the most brilliant soldier
of all history&mdash;Napoleon Bonaparte. General
Galterre and General Niox, the latter in charge
of the famous monument, received the American
General and his staff when they arrived at
the marvelous building.</p>

<p>An interesting incident that was reported as
having occurred directly after the entrance of
the party was the spontaneous action of General
Pershing, when his party met some of the aged
veterans of the former wars of the French. Impulsively
stopping when he was saluted by a
bent and aged soldier who had seen service in
the Crimean War, General Pershing shook the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
old soldier by his hand as he said, "It is a great
honor for a young soldier like myself to press
the hand of an old soldier like yourself who
has seen such glorious service." This natural
and impulsive action by the American is said
to have deeply touched not only the Crimean
veteran, but also all who saw it and even more
those who later heard of it, for the simple act
was soon a topic of conversation among the
already deeply enthused people of Paris.</p>

<p>The American soldiers were conducted first
to the great rotunda where one can stand, and,
looking down, see the tomb of Napoleon resting
in eloquent silence in the sarcophagus beneath.
But the Commander of the American Expeditionary
forces was to have a still more distinctive
honor&mdash;he was to be taken into the
crypt itself. How much of an honor the French
consider this may be judged from the fact that
in addition to the crowned heads of Europe
that had been admitted there, Ex-President
Theodore Roosevelt is the only other American
previously taken to this spot. It was also a part
of the directions which Napoleon himself had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
left that only a Marshal of France was to remain
uncovered in the presence of the Little
Corporal of Corsica.</p>

<p>Naturally the American soldiers followed
this precedent and it was Marshal Joffre himself
who led them to the crypt. The door is
immense and heavy, and made of brass. Just
before the great key was inserted in the lock
and the massive door was slowly to swing open,
Marshal Joffre and General Niox left General
Pershing alone before it. Those who saw him
report that General Pershing drew a deep
breath and then without confusion or delay
quickly turned the key in the lock of the great
brass door.</p>

<p>In a small alcove within the crypt was the
case which held Napoleon's sword. General
Niox quietly unlocked this case and took out
the famous sword and kissed it. Then he extended
the sword to the American soldier.
General Pershing received the weapon, for an
instant held it at salute and then he too kissed
the hilt. One cannot help wondering whether
the impressive moment suggested to the General<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
the mighty contrast between the aims of Napoleon
and those which were guiding the United
States in the desperate war in which she now
was to share. Brilliant as Napoleon was, mighty
strategist and soldier that he proved himself
to be, it is difficult even for his warmest admirers
to defend the principles (or explain the
lack of them) that controlled him in his campaigns.
On the other hand, Pershing was the
representative of a nation which was to fight
with its utmost power&mdash;not for conquest nor to
overthrow its rivals. Vast sums were to be expended,
millions of men were to respond to the
call to the colors&mdash;for what? "To make the
world a decent place to live in." The living
and the dead met in the crypt of the Hotel des
Invalides, but the aims that animated the two
men&mdash;one in the early days of the preceding
century, and the other in the year 1917&mdash;were
as far removed from each other as the East is
from the West.</p>

<p>A ceremony like that with which Napoleon's
sword had been extended to General Pershing
was also followed in the case of the cross of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
the Legion of Honor, the visitor holding it to
his lips a moment and then passing it back to
General Niox. A correspondent writing of the
occasion says: "This was the most signal honor
France ever bestowed upon any man. Before
this occasion not even a Frenchman was permitted
to hold the sacred relics in his hands.
Kings and princes have been taken to the crypt
that holds the body of the great Emperor, but
they only viewed the sword and cross through
the plate glass of the case in which they rested.
The relics had not been touched since the time
of Louis Philippe."</p>

<p>Next followed a formal call upon the American
ambassador and then with lines of soldiers
and the music of many military bands he was
escorted to Elys&eacute;e Palace, where formally he
was to be presented to President Poincar&eacute;.
Still the enthusiasm of the people endeavored
to find expression. Flags and cheers were on
every side. Flowers were cast upon the slowly
advancing procession and there were many
eager watchers, young and old alike, down
whose cheeks unchecked tears were falling. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
occasion was formal and stately, but its necessary
formalities were not able to repress the
deep emotions of the brave and valiant people.</p>

<p>Instead of the enthusiasm dying away it
almost seemed as if it had increased in volume
when General Pershing entered the diplomatic
box that afternoon in the Chamber of Deputies.
Premier Ribot was addressing the body when
the General quietly and without any ostentation
took the seat assigned him.</p>

<p>Speedily, however, the arrival of the American
General became known in the chamber. The
deputies leaped to their feet and cheered and
then remained standing and continued their
cheering. General Pershing was at last compelled
to rise and bow to the assembly in
acknowledgment of the remarkable greeting
which he had received. Then the packed galleries
took up the same theme. "Vive l'Amerique!"
resounded loud and long and then was
repeated again and again, as if the grateful
spectators were fearful lest their former attempts
to express their feelings had not been
adequate. And all this applause was against<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
every tradition and custom of the dignified
Chamber of Deputies.</p>

<p>At last it was possible for the Premier to continue
his address, but no longer was he speaking
of Greece, as he had been when the Americans
had entered, he now was doing his utmost
to portray the might and the unselfish devotion
of the nation across the sea whose leading soldier
was now not only with them in soul, but
also in body. He closed his eloquent address
by quoting the words of President Wilson,
"The day has come to conquer or submit. We
will not submit; we will vanquish."</p>

<p>M. Viviani, who recently had visited the
United States, was the speaker to follow the
Premier. Eloquent, earnest, devoted&mdash;there is
no one to whose words the Chamber usually is
more willing to listen. Viviani at this time also
spoke of the United States&mdash;its people, its President,
its Army and its help, enlarging particularly
on the principles for which both France
and America were fighting.</p>

<p>When the eloquent speaker ended his address,
almost as if the impulse had been kept too long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
under control, the Deputies again rose and
cheered and continued their cheering for General
Pershing, until at last once more he was
compelled to rise and bow in his acknowledgment
of the remarkable ovation he had received.
And the cheers continued after he had
gone.</p>

<p>Before the people of Paris, Joffre and Pershing
stood together, each bare-headed, on the
morning of June 15th. They were on the balcony
of the Military Club. In the Place de
l'Opera was a crowd assembled to do honor to
the two military leaders&mdash;a public reception
by the city. The wild cheering rose in waves.
The excitement was intense. The hopes of the
people, who, as one distinguished Frenchman
said, "had surprised not only the world, but
also their own nation by their bravery, determination
and heroic endurance," were now
keyed to the highest pitch. America was coming.
Nay, America is here in the person of its
commander, whose Alsatian ancestors years
before had found a home in America. Surely
the peoples were indeed one. "Vive l'Amerique!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
"Vive Joffre!" "Vive Pershing!"
It almost seemed as if the cheering would never
stop.</p>

<p>A correspondent describes what occurred in
a momentary lull in the tumult. A young girl,
excited, ardent, patriotic, in a clear call, was
distinctly heard above the cries of the vast
assembly as she shouted, "Vive Joffre, who
saved us from defeat! Vive Pershing, who
brings us victory!"</p>

<p>Instantly the crowd responded and for a
moment it seemed as if the excitement would
break all bounds. The applause became deafening.
The vast assemblage took up the moving
words of the unknown young girl. "Vive
Joffre!" "Vive Pershing!" rose in a wild cry
of joy and hope. Indeed, long after the two
soldiers had withdrawn and the balcony of the
Military Club was no longer occupied, the enthusiastic
crowd refused to depart and the
streets still resounded with "Vive Joffre!"
"Vive Pershing!" Pleased General Pershing
must have been by the wild demonstration of
the affection and hope, and yet he must also<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
have been made intensely serious by the appeal
of two great peoples to lead them to a victory
that should forever put an end to the savagery
and the cruelty which the German nation,
wherever it touched the world through its
army, was manifesting as the controlling motive
in its life.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Wreath for the Tomb of Lafayette</span></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> official calls and the ceremonies that
were designed both to recognize formally the
full meaning of the entrance of the United
States into the world war and to arouse a
fresh enthusiasm in the French people were
almost at an end. General Pershing announced
that on the following day he intended to begin
the work for which he had come. Already
the headquarters of the American Army had
been established at the Rue de Constantin and
the work there was in full operation.</p>

<p>However, there were two other visits which
the American commander desired to make
while he was in Paris. In Picpus Cemetery,
Paris, was the tomb of Lafayette. The friendship
of the young marquis, his enthusiasm for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
the ideals of democracy and the aid he had
given the colonies in America in their struggles
for independence nearly a century and a
half before this time, had made his name as
familiar as it was beloved in the United States.
He had been the personal friend of Washington,
his visit to America after the new nation
had been formed, his gifts and his example
alike had added to the esteem in which he was
held there. As Lafayette had come from
France to help America so now Pershing had
come from America to help France. What
could be more fitting than for the American
commander to manifest publicly the memories
of the deep appreciation which clustered about
the name of Lafayette?</p>

<p>Accordingly General Pershing and a half-dozen
of his officers were taken to the tomb in
Picpus Cemetery. There the little party was
met by the Marquis and the Count de Chambrun
who are direct descendants of Lafayette.
Two orderlies carried a wreath of American
Beauty roses which was to be placed on the
tomb of the ardent young Frenchman. There<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
were no formal or public services&mdash;the occasion
being more like a token of the personal
feelings of the representative of one great nation
for the honored dead who had been the
representative of another. The oft quoted remark
of General Pershing, "Lafayette, we are
here," added to the impressiveness.</p>

<p>General Pershing was welcomed at the cemetery
quietly by the two descendants of Lafayette
and by them was conducted to the tomb.
The General and his fellow officers stood at
salute while the orderlies were placing the
wreath of roses on the marble slab that marked
the final resting place of the brave and brilliant
young French soldier.</p>

<p>In spite of the simplicity of the beautiful
ceremony, however, the enthusiastic people of
Paris felt that somehow they must express
their appreciation of the tender and dignified
tribute to one of their honored dead. Great
throngs lined the streets through which the
party passed, while a vast concourse assembled
in the vicinity of Picpus Cemetery. Their
quickly aroused sentiments had been deeply<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
stirred. A glimpse of the passing American
General was sufficient to deepen this appeal
and the cheers that greeted the Americans were
fervent and heartfelt.</p>

<p>The third day was to be the last of the
formal ceremonies. General Pershing paid the
formal and official calls expected of him, had
luncheon with Marshal Joffre and then visited
the French Senate. As soon as he and Ambassador
Sharp were discovered in the diplomatic
box, every senator sprang to his feet
and the cheering was loud and long&mdash;"Vive
l'Amerique!" "Vive l'Pershing!" It almost
seemed as if the dignified senators were determined
to make their salvos louder and more
genuinely enthusiastic than any that had yet
been heard by the distinguished visitor. Again
and again General Pershing bowed in acknowledgment
of his generous reception.</p>

<p>At last when the senators once more took
their seats, Premier Ribot referred to the
presence of the soldier from the United States
and called upon M. Viviani to speak in acknowledgment
of the event. Eloquent as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
Viviani is known to be, it is said that never
had his words been more expressive or appealing
than on this momentous occasion. Repeatedly
he was compelled to pause and wait for
the applause to cease before he was able to
continue his address. In his final words he
referred to his own recent visit to the United
States and in vivid phrases pictured the conditions
as he had found them there. The ideals
of civilization, the rights of free peoples, the
heritage received from sires who had dearly
paid for that which they bequeathed their
children were to be defended and upheld.
Savagery, brutality, disregard for national and
individual rights were to be overthrown. Because
of the ideals under which the United
States had been reared and the freedom the
nation had enjoyed the people were determined
to share in the battle for the same privileges
to be enjoyed by all mankind.</p>

<p>The response of the audience was instantaneous.
Leaping to their feet they shouted,
"Vivent les Etats Unis!" "Vive l'Amerique!"
"Vive l'Pershing!" Not until after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
General Pershing once more arose and again
and again bowed in acknowledgment of the
soul stirring tribute to him, and through him
to the nation of which he was a part, was quiet
restored. Even then the Senate unanimously
voted a recess of a half-hour to permit the
Senators personally to meet and greet the
American Commander. Antonin Dubost, President
of the Senate, escorted General Pershing
through the imposing lobby of the Luxembourg
and introduced him to the members of
the Senate, one by one. The occasion served
as a fitting climax to three such days as General
Pershing never before had seen and the
world never had known.</p>

<p>Of Pershing's coming to France and of his
gracious, quiet manner of receiving the welcome
of Paris, and his dignity that fitted every
occasion, the Paris newspapers, made much.
The outstanding quality, however, appeared
to be his simplicity. Georges Clemenceau wrote
the following tribute when the three days of
welcome passed:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot"><p>"Paris has given its final welcome to General
Pershing. We are justified in hoping that the acclamations
of our fellow-citizens, with whom are
mingled crowds of soldiers on leave, have shown him
clearly right at the start in what spirit we are waging
this bloodiest of wars: with what invincible determination
never to falter in any fiber of our nerves
or muscles.</p>

<p>"What does France stand for to-day but the most
striking proof of the perseverance of the French
spirit? I can even say that never was such a prolongation
of such terrible sacrifices demanded from
our people and never was it so simply and so easily
obtained.</p>

<p>"Unless I misjudge America, General Pershing,
fully conscious of the importance of his mission, has
received from the cordial and joyous enthusiasm of
the Parisians that kind of fraternal encouragement,
which is never superfluous, even when one needs it
not. Let him have no doubt that he, too, has brought
encouragement to us, the whole of France that followed
with its eyes his passage along the boulevards,
all our hearts, that salute his coming in joy at the
supreme grandeur of America's might enrolled under
the standard of right. This idea M. Viviani, just
back from America, splendidly developed in his eloquent
speech to the Chamber in the presence of General
Pershing.</p>

<p>"General Pershing himself, less dramatic, has given
us in three phrases devoid of artificiality an impression
of exceptionally virile force. It was no rhetoric,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
but the pure simplicity of the soldier who is here to
act and who fears to promise more than he will perform.
No bad sign this for those of us who have
grown weary of pompous words, when we must pay
so dearly for each failure of performance.</p>

<p>"Not long ago the Germans laughed at 'the contemptible
English army' and we hear now that they
regard the American army as too ridiculous for
words. Well, the British have taught even Hindenburg
himself what virile force can do toward filling
gaps in organization. Now the arrival of Pershing
brings Hindenburg news that the Americans are setting
to work in their turn&mdash;those Americans whose
performance in the war of secession showed them
capable of such 'improvisation' of war as the world
has never seen&mdash;and I think the Kaiser must be beginning
to wonder whether he has not trusted rather
blindly in his 'German tribal god.' He has loosed
the lion from its cage, and now finds that the lion
has teeth and claws to rend him.</p>

<p>"The Kaiser had given us but a few weeks in which
to realize that the success of his submarine campaign
would impose the silence of terror on the human conscience
throughout the world. Well, painful as he
must find it, Pershing's arrival in Paris, with its
consequent military action, cannot fail to prove to
him that, after all, the moral forces he ignored must
always be taken into consideration in forecasting
human probabilities. Those learned Boches have yet
to understand that in the course of his intellectual<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
evolution man has achieved the setting of moral right
above brute force; that might is taking its stand beside
right to accomplish the greatest revolution in the
history of mankind.</p>

<p>"That is the lesson Pershing's coming has taught
us, and that is why we rejoice."</p></div>

<p>Another graceful tribute was that of
Maurice de Waleffe who wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"'There is no longer any Pyrenees,' said Louis
XIV when he married a Spanish princess. 'There
is no longer an ocean,' Pershing might say with
greater justice as he is about to mingle with ours
the democratic blood of his soldiers. The fusion of
Europe and America is the enormous fact to note.
Henceforth there is but one human race, in the Old
World as in the New, and we can repeat the words
of Goethe at the battle of Valmy: 'From to-day a
new order of things begins.'"</p></div>

<p>In the evening after his first day of work, at
the opera the enthusiasm of Paris found one
more outlet for its admiration of the American
General whose physical strength and bearing,
whose poise and kindly appreciation of his
welcome again found expression. The General
arrived at the close of the first act. It was
now the turn for the society of Paris to express
itself. The wildest enthusiasm instantly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
seized upon the audience as soon as his arrival
became known. As he entered his box,
which was draped with the American colors,
the orchestra quickly struck up the national
anthem, for the moment drowning even the
wild cheering of the crowded house. The curtain
rose and Mme. Richardson, holding aloft
a large American flag as she advanced to the
front of the stage, began in English to sing
the Star Spangled Banner. After each stanza
the wild cheering seemed to increase in volume
and enthusiasm. Then Mlle. Marthe Chenal
followed and began to sing La Marseillaise.
It was now the turn of the American officers
and soldiers present to cheer for France; and
cheer they did. A chorus of soldiers and
sailors accompanied each singer. When General
Pershing departed from the opera house
the throngs assembled on the streets joined in
another outburst. By this time even the slowest
of Americans must have been fully aware
that the French were glad that the commander
of the Army of the United States was in Paris.</p>

<p>The new problem confronting the American<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
General was stupendous. His recommendations
were to be final at Washington. In his
duties he was to have the assistance of
Marshal Joffre, whose ability as a soldier and
whose position as the official representative of
France would mean much to General Pershing.
The British War Office (May 28, 1917)
had said that including those already serving
in French or British armies there shortly
would be 100,000 American soldiers on French
soil. Within a year the number was to exceed
1,000,000 and hundreds of thousands more were
to follow. No such numbers or speed in transporting
troops 3,500 miles had ever been
known before. And in France plans must be
formed, organizations made, great buildings
must be erected, military measures must be
adopted&mdash;and General John Joseph Pershing
must be the directing power. What a task!
Small cause for surprise is it that he solemnly
said to a prominent clergyman before his departure
from America that he "felt the need
of all the help that could be given him,&mdash;human
and divine."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>Already in France Americans were drilling
in preparation for active fighting. Among
these were detachments of college students
from Harvard, Princeton, Yale, University of
Chicago, Williams, University of California,
and many other American colleges, but a vast
concourse of men from every class and condition
in life in the United States was making
ready to join their fellow soldiers across the
sea. From no man in all the world was more
expected than from General Pershing. And
the expectations were resting on strong
foundations if the manner in which he carried
himself in the four trying days in London and
in the three days of formal ceremonies in
France and then in the beginnings of his heavy
labors in preparing for the demands of
Americans who were yet to come, were indications.
By many he was declared to be the
personification of the best type West Point
could produce.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Fourth of July in France and Bastile Day in America</span></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> manifestation of the feeling of France
and England for the United States as shown
to General Pershing was still further in evidence
when the national holiday of each nation
was celebrated. In this celebration all
three nations united. "Never did I expect to
see a day like the Fourth of July this year in
London," wrote an American stopping in that
city. "The flag of the United States was
everywhere in evidence. I don't think Great
Britain ever saw so many American flags at
one time. The streets almost seemed to be
lined with them. They were hanging from
windows, stretched across the streets and sidewalks,
carried in the hands of the passing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
people and everywhere were in evidence.
Bands were playing the Star Spangled Banner,
public meetings were held, addresses
were made and dinners given&mdash;all showing
that the new feeling between the countries was
not only friendly but also most intensely
cordial. From the King and Queen to the
humblest newsboy the enthusiasm was everywhere
to be seen." And what was true in
London was true also throughout the kingdom.</p>

<p>From the front General Pershing received
the following telegram:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Gen. Pershing</span>: In behalf of myself and
the whole army in France and Flanders I beg you
to accept for yourself and the troops of your command
my warmest greetings on American Independence
Day.</p>

<p>"Fourth of July this year soldiers of America,
France and Great Britain will spend side by side
for the first time in history in defense of the great
principle of liberty, which is the proudest inheritance
and the most cherished possession of their several
nations.</p>

<p>"That liberty which the British, Americans and
French won for themselves they will not fail to hold<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
not only for themselves but for the world. With the
heartiest good wishes for you and your gallant army,</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span style="margin-right: 4em;">"Yours very sincerely,</span><br />
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">"<span class="smcap">D. Haig</span>,</span><br />
"Field Marshal."<br />
</div></div>

<p>To this hearty message of congratulation
and good will General Pershing sent the following
response to the Commander in Chief
of the British Army in France and Flanders:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir Douglas</span>: Independence Day greetings
from the British armies in France, extended by
its distinguished Commander in Chief, are most
deeply appreciated by all ranks of the American
forces. The firm unity of purpose that on the Fourth
of July this year so strongly binds the great allied
nations together stands as a new declaration and a
new guarantee that the sacred principles of liberty
shall not perish but shall be extended to all peoples.</p>

<p>"With the most earnest good wishes from myself
and entire command to you and our brave British
brothers in arms, I remain, always in great respect
and high esteem,</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span style="margin-right: 6em;">"Yours very sincerely,</span><br />
"<span class="smcap">John J. Pershing.</span>"<br />
</div></div>

<p>In Paris also the celebration was an evidence
of the same or even greater enthusiasm.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
Flags, bands, cheers, songs, public meetings
and addresses&mdash;these all were like a repetition
of the scenes that had greeted the arrival
of the American commander on the soil of
France. Once more General Pershing was the
idol of the day, because in this way the French
people best believed they could express their
deep appreciation of the part America was
promptly taking in the fight for freedom.</p>

<p>The response of America was equally strong
when ten days later the great country, more
than 3,000 miles away, joined in a hearty celebration
of the French national holiday&mdash;Bastile
Day. As Lafayette had brought to and
presented to the United States the key to the
famous old prison so it seemed almost as if
the key had unlocked the doors of every American
heart. The French flag was flying from
thousands of buildings. The French national
air was heard on every side.</p>

<p>In America, too, just as there had been a
brief time before in France, there were great
assemblies quickly aroused to the highest pitch
of enthusiasm by the words of orators describing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
the marvelous heroism and devotion of
France in the present world war. As one
famous, speaker said, "France had not only
found her soul and surprised the world by her
devotion; she had even surprised herself."</p>

<p>Perhaps the celebration in America reached
its highest point in a vast meeting in the
Madison Square Garden in New York City on
the evening of July 14th. One newspaper
glowingly described the vast concourse that
filled the Garden: "It isn't too much to say
that perhaps the air quivered no more violently
around the Bastile on that great day in
Paris 129 years ago, than it did in Madison
Square Garden last night when at the apex of
a day of glorious tribute to France a tall young
man wearing the horizon blue of the French
army and noted throughout the world for his
singing, sang with splendid fervor France's&mdash;and
now in a way our own&mdash;'La <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original missing the closing double quotation mark">Marseillaise.'"</ins> </p>

<p>The Garden fairly rocked with the applause,
as banners and flags were waved in the hands
of the excited, shouting throng. French soldiers
with the little marks upon their sleeves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
that showed the bravery on the battlefield of
the men privileged to wear them, soldiers and
sailors of many lands, war-nurses in their cool
white costumes, men who had fought in
France, Belgium, Serbia, Italy, at Gallipoli, at
the Marne and at Verdun&mdash;and many more
were there to assist in expressing the feelings
of America for her ally.</p>

<p>"They shall not pass"&mdash;it was almost like
the determination of the men that doggedly
stood before and blocked the Germans as they
did their utmost to drive through Verdun.</p>

<p>A message from General Foch was read by
the chairman, Charles E. Hughes. "After
four years of struggle the plans of the enemy
for domination are stopped," began Judge
Hughes, but he also was compelled to "stop"
until the deafening applause that interrupted
the reading of the message from the great
French commander had quieted down sufficiently
to enable him to proceed. After several
minutes passed he resumed. "He (the enemy)
sees the numbers of his adversaries increase
each day and the young American army bring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
into the battle a valor and a faith without
equal; is not this a sure pledge of the definite
triumph of the just cause?"</p>

<p>If the true answer to the question of the
commander of all the armies of the allies was
to be measured by the mighty roar that spontaneously
arose, then the General must have
been convinced as well as satisfied.</p>

<p>"We are doing more to-night than paying
tribute," declared the chairman. "We are
here to make our pledge. We make our
pledge to the people of France. We make our
pledge and it is the pledge of a people able to
redeem it."</p>

<p>Secretary of the Navy Daniels read a message
from President Wilson: "America greets
France on this day of stirring memories, with
a heart full of warm friendship and of devotion
to the great cause in which the two peoples
are now so happily united. July 14th, like our
own July 4th, has taken on a new significance
not only for France but for the world. As
France celebrated our Fourth of July, so do
we celebrate her Fourteenth, keenly conscious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
of a comradeship of arms and of purpose of
which we are deeply proud.</p>

<p>"The sea seems very narrow to-day, France
is a neighbor to our hearts. The war is being
fought to save ourselves from intolerable
things, but it is also being fought to save mankind.
We extend other hands to each other, to
the great peoples with whom we are associated
and the peoples everywhere who love right and
prize justice as a thing beyond price, and consecrate
ourselves once more to the noble enterprise
of peace and justice, realizing the great
conceptions that have lifted France and
America high among the free peoples of the
earth.</p>

<p>"The French flag floats to-day from the staff
of the White House and America is happy to
do honor to that flag."</p>

<p>A similar statement was made by Great
Britain's ambassador, the Earl of Reading, who
declared that Bastile Day was also being celebrated
throughout the British Empire.</p>

<p>The climax came when Ambassador Jusserand
spoke:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Your national fete and ours have the same meaning:
Emancipation. The ideal they represent is so
truly the same, that it is no wonder, among the
inspiring events in which we live, that France celebrated
the other day your Fourth and you are now
celebrating our Fourteenth. We owe so much to
each other in our progress toward Freedom.</p>

<p>"Those enthusiastic French youths who served
under Washington, Rochambeau and Lafayette had
seen liberty and equality put into practice, and had
brought back to France the seed, which sown at an
opportune moment, sprang up and grew wonderfully.</p>

<p>"The two greatest events in our histories are
closely connected. Between the end of your revolution
and the beginning of ours, there elapsed only six
years. Our flag, devised the day after the fall of
the Bastile, combining the same colors as your own,
is just a little younger than your Old Glory, born
in revolutionary times. And the two, floating for
the first time together over the trenches of distant
France, defying the barbaric enemy, have much to
say to each other, much about the past, much about
the future.</p>

<p>"United as we are with the same firmness of purpose,
we shall advance our standards and cause the
enemy to understand that the best policy is honesty,
respect of others' freedom and respect of the sworn
pledge.</p>

<p>"That song of freedom, the 'Marseillaise' will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
again be sung at the place of its birth, that Alsatian
song born in Strassburg, justifying its original title,
a 'War song of the Rhine.'</p>

<p>"The place where he shall stop is not, however,
written on the map, but in our hearts, a kind of map
the enemy has been unable to decipher. But what
is written is plain enough, and President Wilson is
even plainer in his memorable speech at the Tomb
of Washington on your own Fourth. It comes to
this: 'One more Bastile remains to be taken, representing
feudalism, autocracy, despotism, the German
one, and when it falls, peace will reign again.'"</p></div>

<p>And over in France was an American&mdash;brave,
kind of heart, dignified and tremendously
in earnest who stood before the people
of the old world as the very personification of
the spirit that animated the new world.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Incidents and Characteristics</span></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of the most striking elements in the grip
which General Pershing has upon his soldiers
is well shown by the following extract from a
letter which a quiet, unknown doughboy recently
sent from France to his mother: "I think
I forgot to tell you that Pershing looked us
over. He is a wonderful man to look at.
Power is written all over his face. Believe me,
with a man like that in the lead we ought to
win, hands down. Just one look commands
respect and confidence."</p>

<p>One reason for this confidence doubtless is
the frequently expressed opinion which the
commander also has of his men. Again and
again he has publicly declared that the idealism
of the American soldier boys was bound
to win this war. "They will defend these ideals<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
at any sacrifice." And those who are aware of
the spirit of many a young American student
in college or worker on some quiet farm, will
understand why General Pershing has made so
much of this idealism which he says is the
backbone of the American fighting men in
France.</p>

<p>It is not only the General, but the man Pershing
behind the General that makes its appeal
and finds its response from the American boys.
In every Y. M. C. A. hut in France to-day there
is hanging a picture of the leader of the American
armies. Underneath this picture are the
following words, which bear his own signature:</p>

<p>"Hardship will be your lot but trust in God
will give you comfort. Temptation will befall
you but the teaching of our Saviour will give
you strength. Let your valor as a soldier and
your conduct as a man be an inspiration to
your comrades and an honor to your country."</p>

<p>The meaning of these words perhaps becomes
more apparent if for a moment they are placed
in contrast with the reported relations existing
between the German soldiers and their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
officers, sometimes driven into battle by brutal
methods, threatened, kicked and beaten, and if
they protested, sometimes the gunners were
chained to their guns&mdash;small cause for surprise
is it that the American boys fail to appreciate
the "blessings" of autocracy or are determined
that the brutality and aims of all war lords
shall forever perish from the earth.</p>

<p>Then, too, his personal interest in the young
American fighter who has done something to
deserve recognition is one of his elements of
strength. There must, however, first have been
given an indication that the deed was worthy
of praise&mdash;for General Pershing's commendation
is not cheap nor does he scatter it promiscuously.
The following incident may be looked
upon as <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original missing the period">typical</ins></p>

<p>John Kulolski, born in Poland, emigrant to
the United States, enlisted at Buffalo, New
York, June 7, 1916. In the following year, on
his birthday, he re&euml;nlisted and on the same
month and day in 1918 he was sent to the
trenches. Indeed, he declared that his birthday
"always brought something great into his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
life." His first service in the army was as a
cook, but at his own request he was transferred
to the fighting forces. Cooking might
be necessary, but it was "too slow for him."
Soon in the Bois de Belleau he found his opportunity.
The fighting was savage and John
Kulolski's company was in peril from a nearby
gunners' nest. Suddenly, without orders and
with the new spirit of initiative which had
been acquired by the young Pole in America,
he darted ahead alone, and by the sheer force
of his own impetuous act charged the gun and
made prisoners of the gun crew and its officer.
Doubtless his very daring caused his enemies
to believe that he was not alone but was one
of many who were about to attack them. At
all events the Germans surrendered to John
Kulolski and his bravery was quickly known
all along the line.</p>

<p>To him as soon as he heard of his daring deed
General Pershing sent the following telegram
from headquarters:</p>

<div class="blockquot">"For Private Kulolski, Company (deleted).

<p>"I have just heard of your splendid conduct on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
June 6th when you alone charged a gun, captured
it and its crew, together with an officer. I have
awarded you the Distinguished Service Cross. I congratulate
you.</p>

<div class='sig'>
"<span class="smcap">Pershing.</span>"<br />
</div></div>

<p>Who does not know that Kulolski's deed and
the commander's quick and personal as well as
official recognition of the heroism of this private
soldier at once aroused a spirit of gratitude
and enthusiasm not only in the heart of
the young Pole, but also caused a thrill in the
heart of every doughboy in the ranks that
heard the story?</p>

<p>From Paris, July 22, 1918, the Associated
Press sent the following despatch:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Your country is proud of you, and I am more
than proud to command such men as you. You have
fought splendidly."</p></div>

<p>General Pershing thus addressed wounded
American soldiers lying in the American Red
Cross hospitals in Paris to-day. In each ward
of every hospital he talked to the men. He inquired
if they were being well cared for, how
and where they were wounded, what regiments<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
they belonged to, and expressed his sympathy
to scores of patients.</p>

<p>General Pershing also talked to the physicians,
surgeons, and nurses, and thanked them
for the work they were doing in caring for the
wounded.</p>

<p>"No one can ask of any fighting force more
than that they should do as well as you have
done," he said to his troops. The General
added that he wished he could speak personally
with each and every man in the hospital, but
this was impossible. So he asked Major James
H. Perkins to repeat his message and say to
each individual man, "The American people
are proud of you."</p>

<p>It is a very devoted and democratic army
which General Pershing commands in France.
Those who know him personally have a deep
affection for him for they understand what he
is. Those who do not have a personal acquaintance
admire him no less for what they believe
him to be. It is a common remark in the ranks,
even by those who never even saw their leader,
"What a fine man Pershing is." His nickname<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
"Black Jack" is an expression of admiration
and affection, as much so as when the French
poilus tenderly refer to "Papa" Joffre.</p>

<p>Whenever General Pershing in his scattered
duties arrives at a place where there are
wounded American soldiers he never fails to
find a few brief minutes when he can visit these
boys and speak a word of affectionate appreciation
of what they have done. It is usually,
however, not to his own but to his country's
pride and sympathy that he refers. "Your
country is proud of you." Sometimes it is just
a handclasp, sometimes only a glance from his
dark eyes, expressive of the deep interest and
pride in his soldier boys that he can give the
wounded. He is a man of few words and as a
consequence every spoken word counts.</p>

<p>A direct report states that "faces are
brighter, eyes have a new expression whenever,
which is as often as the crush of his duties permits&mdash;he
visits a hospital."</p>

<p>One further incident will illustrate the
many-sided activities of the American General.
One evening at a certain nameless point he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
found that he had a very few minutes free
before his automobile was to rush him to the
next place he was to visit. Instantly he decided
to visit the Y. M. C. A. hut. As he drew
near he found that a couple of hundred boys
were in the building and that someone was
"banging the piano" with a furious rag-time.
Hobnailed shoes were noisily keeping time to
the music and the lusty voices of the shouting
and singing young soldiers were plainly heard
far beyond the building. Not one of the boys
was aware that the commander was anywhere
in the vicinity.</p>

<p>Suddenly a yell arose near the entrance.
Instantly every soldier turned to discover the
cause of the break. "General Pershing" ran as
a loud whisper throughout the assembly and
instantly every one of the assembled doughboys
sprang to his feet and stood at attention. Then
no longer able to repress or restrain their feelings
they united in such an enthusiastic yell
as might have revealed their presence to an
enemy if he was not too far away.</p>

<p>Quickly the General was in the midst of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
throng and was telling his admirers just how
he had "dropped in to see how they were getting
along." He was delighted, he told them,
to find everything in good order and expressed
his deep satisfaction with the manner in which
they were doing their part in the gigantic
struggle. "Your country is proud of you."</p>

<p>Small cause for wonder is it that it is currently
reported that "no army ever went to the
battlefield better protected against the pitfalls
of army life than the American forces in
France." Every friendly and helpful activity
receives his cordial support&mdash;Red Cross, Y. M.
C. A., Knights of Columbus, Salvation Army
and all. He is deeply concerned not only with
the quality and quantity of the work in France
but also with the reports that are to go back
home concerning what the boys are doing on
the far distant fields of France. Still more is
he concerned about the effects of their stay
upon the boys themselves. "Everything possible
is being done to see that these young
Americans who will return home some day
shall go back clean."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>He is deeply interested in all the athletics
and sports of his troops. He simply is insistent
upon one main quality, "everything
must be clean."</p>

<p>A certain reporter for a New York newspaper
sends the following incident:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Passing a dark corner one night I encountered a
M. P. (Military Policeman). Some of the M. P.s
are a bit rough. They have to be, and they would
wade into a den of wildcats.</p>

<p>"Hey, you pencil pusher," he called, "did you
see the big boss?"</p>

<p>I had.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "you've flashed your lamps on
the finest man that ever stood in shoe leather."</p></div>

<p>One day General Pershing arrived at a station
where a motley crowd greeted his coming.
The following day there was posted on a bulletin
board of the barracks a cordial commendation
of the young French officer who had so
efficiently done his duty at the station in handling
the somewhat unruly assembly at the arrival
of the American commander and his staff.
That is General Pershing's way. Quietly cordial,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
looking for good in every one of his men
and usually finding it, a strict disciplinarian
and quick to punish neglect or an evil deed, he
is the idol of the army.</p>

<p>"General Pershing is one of the finest men
I ever met. Everybody in the army admires
him greatly," declares a prominent American
officer, and another adds, "I have never met a
nobler man in my life than General Perching."</p>

<p>According to a statement of an orderly sergeant
of the commander, the General has a regular
order for beginning the work of every day.
Rising at five o'clock there is first a half hour
of setting up exercises which the two men take
together. Next the General, although he is at
an age when most men abandon running except
as a necessity or a last resort, goes out for
a run of fifteen minutes. Later there is a united
attack upon the medicine ball and there is no
slight or "ladylike" exercise. Although the
sergeant is twenty-five years younger than the
General, he acknowledges that he is usually
the first to declare that he has had sufficient
for the beginning of the day.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>The hour of retirement is usually eleven
o'clock, and just before that time there are
more setting up exercises, after which the sergeant
says he himself is entirely reconciled to
the suggestion to turn in.</p>

<p>In this way and because he has followed this
somewhat strenuous plan since he was a young
man General Pershing has kept himself in magnificent
physical condition.</p>

<p>Indeed, the sergeant said that in the ten
years during which he had been the commander's
orderly he has never known but one day
when the General was <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'incapicitated'">incapacitated</ins> for his
duties. That day was in the early rush of the
punitive expedition into Mexico to get Villa.
The change of water or perhaps the quality of
it made him ill, but even then, in spite of the
surgeon's advice for him to remain quietly in
his tent for a day or two, General Pershing,
unmindful of the influence of his example, "disobeyed
orders" and resumed his work. Fortunately
no ill effects followed his disobedience.</p>

<p>A tender touch in the sergeant's statement is
one upon which we have no right to enlarge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
though the fact is as suggestive as it is characteristic.
The first duty of the orderly in
unpacking the General's belongings when they
move to new quarters is to take the photograph
of Mrs. Pershing and the four children as the
family was before that terrible fire in the Presidio,
and place it <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'in'">on</ins> a desk or bureau where
it is easily seen. Often the General sits in
silence before it, and as he looks at the family
group, the sergeant believes that, for the time,
the tragedy is forgotten and to the silent soldier
his family again seems to be complete. It is
an occasion into which an outsider, however,
has no right to enter and however strong may
be his sympathy, the sorrow is too intensely
personal for even a close friend to obtrude.</p>

<p>In the letter which General Pershing wrote
from Mindanao to his classmates on the occasion
of their twenty-fifth anniversary of their
graduation from West Point he lightly referred
to his difficulties in acquiring French. In view
of his ancestry, for his name and lineage can
be traced back to Alsace, this at first may appear
somewhat strange; but the statement is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
his own. However, when he first went to
France his fluency in the language of the people
of that country was not sufficient to satisfy him
and an interpreter was provided, who usually
was present when he met with French officers
who were as ignorant of his language as he was
of theirs. In a brief time, however, the interpreter
was discarded. General Pershing, in
spite of the difficulty of acquiring a new language
when one is older, was soon conversing
in their own tongue with Marshal Joffre, General
Petain and General Foch. Just what the
opinion of his accent was we do not know and
they doubtless were too polite to express it. The
essential point, however, is that just as the
American Commander years before had learned
the language of the Moros in order to assist
him in his task of dealing with the little brown
people, so he resolutely set to work to learn
French, at least to an extent that enabled him
to understand what was said in his presence
and to express himself to his friends without
the aid of an interpreter.</p>

<p>Not long before the raid upon Columbus by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
Villa and his bandits General Pershing, in a
letter from which the following extract is taken,
wrote: "We do not want war if we can honestly
avoid it, but we must not hesitate to make
war if the cause of civilization and progress
demands it. Nearly every step in human
progress has been at the sacrifice of human life.
There are some things dearer even than life.
If a nation has set up high ideals either for
itself or for others it must be prepared to enforce
those ideals if need be by armies and
navies. Of course it would be better to enforce
them through moral prestige." These sentiments
were expressed long before the declaration
of war with Germany or the President had
written his famous words about making the
world safe for democracy. They are doubly
interesting for that reason and expressive of
General Pershing's innermost feelings when
there was every reason why he should express
himself freely. Most brilliant American fighters
have not been lovers of war for its own sake.
Washington was reluctant to enter upon war,
although when he believed there was no escape<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
he fought to the uttermost limit of his power.
General Grant's most frequently quoted words
are not warlike, but "Let us have peace." And
General Pershing is not one whit behind the
other two.</p>

<p>Early in July, 1918, Chairman Hurley sent a
cablegram to the American fighting men in
France that the shipbuilders at home would
launch one hundred merchant ships July 4th.
Promptly from General Pershing came the following
appreciative and defiant acknowledgment:
"The launching of one hundred ships on
the Fourth of July is the most inspiring news
that has come to us. All ranks of the Army in
France send their congratulations and heartfelt
thanks to their patriotic brothers in the ship-yards
at home. No more defiant answer could
be given to the enemy's challenge. With such
backing we cannot fail to win. All hail American
shipbuilders."</p>

<p>His quick sense of appreciation is seen also
in the following telegram which he sent Premier
Clemenceau after the hearty congratulations
sent by the great Frenchman on the occasion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
of the parade of American troops in Paris
in the celebration of the Fourth of July:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Permit me to tell you how much I am touched
by the cordial telegram you sent me. I shall not
fail to make it known to the troops in question. All
the officers and men of the troops who had the privilege
of participating in the Fourth of July ceremony
in Paris will retain unforgettable recollections of
the enthusiastic reception accorded to them. Proud
of the confidence France places in them they are
heartened more than ever to do their duty until
common victory comes."</p></div>

<p>One day in France he saw two American
soldiers at work on a woodpile. One glance was
sufficient to show him that the two men were
working out a form of punishment for some
misdeed. As we know General Pershing is a
believer in strict and if necessary stern discipline.
Soon after coming to France he had
ordered one American soldier to be hanged for
a nameless crime and several others to be disciplined
severely for drunkenness. Believing in
the best and hoping and expecting the good in
every one of his men to manifest itself, nevertheless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
he is severe when severity is demanded.
And he was at once interested when he first saw
the two American boys at the <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'wood pile'">woodpile</ins>, manifestly
serving a sentence of some kind.</p>

<p>Stopping his automobile, General Pershing
sent his orderly to find out what the offense was
for which the two soldiers were serving their
sentence. Upon the orderly's return he reported
that the two men had taken "French
leave" of their company several days before
this time. They were jealous because certain
of their fellows "had been sent up ahead to
fight" while they had been left behind. And
they were eager to fight. They had enlisted
and come to France for that express purpose.
And now to be left behind! The thought was
more than the two Yankee boys could endure.
Fight they could and fight they would&mdash;with
or without specific orders from their officers.
And fight they did, for without any ceremony
they departed for the front one night and kept
on going until they found it. According to
their own story they "found war and mixed
in." And also they were found out and sentenced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
to serve five days at the woodpile as a
penalty for their disobedience and over-hasty
zeal. It is said General Pershing hastily departed
from the spot and that he laughed heartily
at the story of Americans who were punished
not because they were not willing to fight,
but were so eager that they did not wait for
such a little thing as orders or commands. And
then the General fell to talking about his favorite
theme&mdash;the daring and bravery of his men
in the campaign against the Moros.</p>

<p>One day in Paris, General Pershing saw a
tiny man&mdash;a dwarf&mdash;upon the sidewalk of the
street through which he was passing at the
time. The little man instantly recalled to the
commander the wedding of Datto Dicky of Jolo.
The little chieftain was about to be married.
There was a current report that he was the
smallest man in the world, but the statement
has not been verified. At all events, whatever
he may have lacked in stature he more than
made up in his power over the tribe of which
he was a chief.</p>

<p>At a fair in Zamboanga, Datto Dicky was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
about to take unto himself a wife, the little lady
being as diminutive as her prospective husband.
After the formal wedding General Pershing
presented to the bride a tiny house in every
way adapted to the needs of such a diminutive
couple. The dwelling stood on stilts on the
beach, a thing of beauty in the eyes of all the
Moros that were attending the fair.</p>

<p>The tiny chieftain and his bride gratefully
accepted the present of the little building,
which they occupied during their honeymoon.
Upon their return to Jolo they in turn gave
their present to the children of the General and
they used it as a playhouse. As Datto Dicky
is said to have been just two feet and three
inches in height the little children of the American
governor doubtless found the structure
much to their liking and well adapted to their
needs. They were as delighted over Dicky's
generosity to them as the diminutive chieftain
had been over the unexpected gift their father
had given him.</p>

<p>The following incidents are taken from the
New York <i>Times</i>:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"About ten years ago he and Mrs. Pershing were
in Paris and the General, who was then a captain,
was suffering from a slight indisposition, which his
doctor thought might be attributable to smoking.
Upon Mrs. Pershing's insistence the captain went to
Mannheim where there was a famous cure. The resident
doctor examined him and advised that he give
up smoking. It happened that Pershing had always
been an inveterate smoker. His cigar was a part of
his life. He wrestled with the question a day or
two and made up his mind that he would follow the
medical advice.</p>

<p>"When asked if he hadn't found the job a hard
one and whether he wasn't still tempted the reply
was:</p>

<p>"'Not in the least, the only hard thing was in
making up his mind. He had hardly given the matter
a thought since.'</p>

<p>"There are two subjects which the General will
always talk about with interest&mdash;his farming experience
and his four years with the Moros in the
Philippines.</p>

<p>"He loves to hark back to those days when his
highest obligation was to get out into the cornfield
at the very earliest minute in the morning that there
was daylight enough to see the ears of corn. When
he was fourteen he took the management of the farm.
His father had been a rich man, but the panic of
1873 broke him. John was the oldest of nine children
and he had to go to the front. In everything<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
that he does now I can detect the influence of his
early training. I can see in the General of to-day
the farmer boy with his contempt of hardship, the
country school teacher with his shepherding instinct
for those around him and the general wariness of
country bringing-up. It is inexorably true that the
boy is father to the man."</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">What Others Think of Him</span></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> quoting a few words from the opinions
others have expressed concerning the American
Commander doubtless some of them may
seem to be a trifle too laudatory. It is not to
be forgotten that the words of those who perhaps
did not fully share the sentiments have
not been recorded. If such opinions exist,
their record has not been brought to the attention
of the writer. As a rule, Americans have
no comparative degree in their estimates of
men. They like a man or they do not like him.
He is either a success or a failure, good or
bad, wise or foolish. Between the two extremes
there is little standing room, and into one <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'catagory'">category</ins>
or the other they cast nearly everyone.
If General Pershing has not escaped this condition,
his consolation doubtless is that he is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
merely sharing the common lot of his fellow-citizens.</p>

<p>A close friend has this to say of him: "You
should meet him at a dinner party and listen
to his stories. You should stand with him before
his tent in the field, in the sunshine&mdash;he
loves the sunshine and the wide out-of-doors&mdash;and
hear him tell stories of his campaigning
at his best. You should meet this big man with
the heart of a little child, this man who by
befriending his enemies has made them his
companions, this man who stands up erect and
faces the horrors of disaster with a smile and
prays in his heart for the sufferers."</p>

<p>Another friend says: "There is something
about Pershing that reminds one of Lincoln.
It may be his ready wit and never failing good
humor or perhaps his big sympathetic heart.
In the army the similarity is frequently pointed
out."</p>

<p>An officer who served under him in the
Punitive Expedition into Mexico and was
thrown into close relations with him writes: "I
have had the pleasure of knowing many of our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
great men, but Pershing is the biggest of them
all. He combines the rugged simplicity of
Lincoln with the dogged perseverance of
Grant; the strategic mystical ability of Stonewall
Jackson and the debonair personality of
McClellan. In one quality, that of intuition, he
may be inferior possibly to Roosevelt, but in
cold logic and in supreme knowledge of human
nature and of soldier nature I have never met
his equal."</p>

<p>The colonel of his regiment when Pershing
was a lieutenant in the 10th Cavalry said of
him: "I have been in many fights but on my
word he is the bravest and coolest man under
fire I ever saw."</p>

<p>In 1903, Elihu Root, then Secretary of State,
in President McKinley's cabinet, cabled him:
"The thanks of the War Department for the
able and effective accomplishment of a difficult
and important task."</p>

<p>A simpler, but no less effective estimate of
his character, although it was given in a way
to puzzle him and perhaps also was a source
of embarrassment was the act of the Sultan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
of Oato who officially made young Major
Pershing the "father" of his eighteen-year-old
boy. This was the highest tribute the ruler
of the tribe could pay, to give his own son to
the American officer. And this was done, too,
when by his training and religion the Mohammedan
chieftain looked down upon even if he
did not despise a Christian.</p>

<p>Georges Clemenceau, whose words have been
previously quoted, has this to say concerning
the directness and simplicity of the American
General: "General Pershing has given us in
three phrases devoid of artificiality, an impression
of exceptionally virile force. It was no
rhetoric, but pure simplicity of the soldier who
is here to act and who fears to promise more
than he will perform. No bad sign this, for
those of us who have grown weary of pompous
words when we must pay dearly for each failure
of performance."</p>

<p>An intimate friend of his boyhood writes:
"John was and still is intensely human and
that is why we all love him. His old playmates
and friends are proud of his success as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
a soldier, but they love him because of his high
standard of principles and unswerving integrity.
John J. Pershing is revered by the entire
population of Linn County, Missouri,
and I hope in the near future to see a statue
of Pershing erected in the beautiful town park
of Laclede, in his honor."</p>

<p>A well-known college president writes of him:
"It is his foresight as distinct from vision
which has most impressed me. He sees what
ought to be done and then does it. His spirit
of determination, his persistence, his foresightedness,
seem to me the predominant traits in
a well-rounded character. Strength rather
than brilliancy, solidity, reliability, saneness
are other terms by which the same qualities
might be defined."</p>

<p>Another distinguished president of a college
in General Pershing's native State makes the
following analysis: "I have been here twenty-six
years and have had a good deal to do with
young men. I have never seen a man yet that
had these characteristics that failed in his life
work:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>First</i>, Pershing's modesty.</p>

<p>"<i>Second</i>, His friendliness&mdash;his ability to get
along with his fellows.</p>

<p>"<i>Third</i>, His industry.</p>

<p>"<i>Fourth</i>, What the boys call, 'everlastingly
on the job'&mdash;always in his place, always had
his lessons, always performed his duties.</p>

<p>"<i>Fifth</i>, His courage in facing every obstacle.</p>

<p>"<i>Sixth</i>, His forward look&mdash;his looking
ahead.</p>

<p>"My secretary adds that I have omitted one
of the strongest of General Pershing's attributes&mdash;his
sense of right."</p>

<p>It is a great asset when the people of a man's
native town speak of him, even of his boyhood,
in terms of affection and confidence. It is to
his credit when school and college mates write
of their belief in his sterling character. It is
a source of pride when the early efforts of a
young man, in the trying days of his first
experiences in his chosen profession, find a
cordial response to his efforts and it is a still
deeper source of gratification when he has done
his best and has received recognition and reward<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
from the nation at large. And then when
maturer days have <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'came'">come</ins> and the glitter and
the glamour have lost much of their appeal, for
one to find that the great ones of the earth
recognize and value more highly than the doer
the deeds he has done&mdash;all this is a heritage
the children and the coming generations will
receive with grateful hearts. All these are a
part of the possessions of General John Joseph
Pershing.</p>

<p>The supreme honor thus far which General
Pershing has received is the recognition from
his own country which found its expression in
his appointment as General, October 6, 1917,
"with rank from that date, during the existence
of the present emergency, under the provisions
of an Act of Congress approved October 6,
1917."</p>

<p>When, on October 8, 1917, he accepted this
appointment what thoughts must have been in
his mind. He had then received the highest
military honor the United States of America
could bestow upon a soldier. He was the successor
in office of Washington, Grant, Sherman<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
and Sheridan. What a wonderful list of
honored names it is! And a half-century had
elapsed since anyone had received such an
appointment. The wildest dream of the young
captain of cadets at West Point had come true.
And he had expressed his opinion just before
he went to West Point that there would be
slight opportunity for promotion in the permanent
peace which apparently had settled
over the nations of the earth. It is a source
of comfort to learn that even the wisest and
the best of men are sometimes compelled to
revise their judgments.</p>

<p>It is not incredible that the gift which
Marshal Joffre provided, or at least one in
which he was the prime instigator, the presentation
of a small gold-mounted sword for
General Pershing's little son, Warren, may
have touched the General's heart as deeply as
any honor he ever received. A sword from
the Field Marshal of France, given in the
greatest war ever fought by mankind! And
we may be sure that however kindly the feeling
of the foremost soldiers of France may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
have been for little Warren Pershing the gift
nevertheless was made to the boy because he
is the son of his father.</p>

<p>A similar method of expressing the regard
for the father by a gift to his son was followed
in an incident in the celebration of Bastile
Day in Paris, July 14, 1918. At the general
headquarters of the American Army in France
the members of the graduating class of the
Lycee presented to the American Commander
a marvelously bound volume of episodes in the
history of France. This beautiful work, however,
was "to be transmitted to Warren Pershing
from his comrades of the Lycee."</p>

<p>What other people than the French would
have thought of such a dainty and yet effective
way of expressing their admiration of a man?
Sometimes a son objects to being known chiefly
because he bears the name of his father. It
is seldom, however, that a man ever objects to
being known as the father of his son.</p>

<p>Just before this volume was given by the
students, General Pershing had presented their
diplomas to the members of the graduating<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
class of the Lycee. This very pleasing duty
had followed after he had formally received
the American troops and the French societies
which had marched through the streets that
were gay with brilliant decorations and
thronged by cheering thousands.</p>

<p>On August 7, 1918, there appeared in many
American newspapers the following brief and
simple message from France:</p>

<div class="blockquot">"With the American Armies in France, Aug. 6.

<p>"President <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Poincare'">Poincar&eacute;</ins> personally decorated General
Pershing with the Grand Cross of the Legion of
Honor this morning with impressive military ceremonies
at American General Headquarters."</p></div>

<p>This was all that was cabled, but a column
would not have added to the meaning. As far
as military recognition was concerned France
could do no more. Her choicest honor, the one
most highly prized by her patriotic soldiers,
had been bestowed upon a soldier from across
the sea, not only as a token of her esteem for
the man, but also for the country which had
chosen him to be the leader of her armies.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>Nor was this the only honor of its kind.
England already had shown her appreciation
by awarding him the Grand Cross of the Order
of the Bath&mdash;an honor which it is said was then
bestowed for the first time upon a soldier of
a foreign nation, or at least upon a soldier from
the United States.<a name="FNanchor_D_1" id="FNanchor_D_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_1" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> And other similar orders
and decorations were given and by different nations.
It is difficult in democratic America to
appreciate just how much such recognition
means in the lands in which they were so generously
bestowed. We may be certain, however,
that these honors, which are rare, were
not bestowed thoughtlessly and that General
Pershing was deeply appreciative in each instance
of the motive and feeling that lay behind
the gift.</p>


<p>Without question, the honor which most
deeply touches the General is the confidence
and affection of the men he commands. This
is more and deeper than mere popularity. The
latter varies and shifts as a weathercock veers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
with the changing winds. Many of the world's
great characters have not only not had it, but
have suffered martyrdom because they or
their teachings were unpopular. But the deep
regard, the confidence and pride which the
American forces universally manifest for their
leader are based primarily, not upon their impulses
or impressions, but upon their belief in
the qualities he has quietly manifested, the
record he has made, and the power of his own
personality.</p>

<p>Deeply impressed as the American commander
must be by the receptions given him,
the formal honors bestowed upon him by his
own and other countries, there is still a minor
chord that sounds in the chorus of acclaim.
What would the mother, who in the little Missouri
village first fired his boyish heart with
an earnest desire to make the most of himself,
say now if she was here to treasure in her
heart the words that have been spoken in
memory of the deeds he has done? And his
wife&mdash;if she had not perished in the fire at the
Presidio, and now could follow his career with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
the pride which a good woman ever has in the
recognition of her husband, what added
strength her sympathy and fellowship would
give to the arm and heart of the man whose
name and lot she shared. Sometimes there are
tragedies for our soldiers greater even than
the battlefields provide.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">As a Writer and Speaker</span></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> two predominant qualities that have
marked General Pershing in other lines of
activity naturally appear in his written and
spoken words. These are simplicity and forcefulness.</p>

<p>He writes but little and then only when he
has something to say. What he has to say he
tells and then stops. His style is lucid and interesting;
even his early reports make good
reading.</p>

<p>Certain of his sayings have almost the force
of proverbs. For example, when one has once
heard, "Germany can be beaten; Germany must
be beaten; Germany will be beaten," he can
never forget the terse epigrammatic phrasing.
The same thing is true also of his response to
the message of the French school children who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
invaded his headquarters, bringing their
Fourth of July greetings:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>To-day constitutes a new Declaration of Independence,
a solemn oath that the liberty for which
France has long been fighting will be attained.</p></div>

<p>It is not much when measured in words, but
it is enough when behind it is the man.</p>

<p>Similarly terse and appealing are his words
already referred to, hanging in every Y. M. C.
A. hut in France.</p>

<p>He is not an orator in the sense of being
oratorical, but he is conversational, direct and
impressive in public address. His soldierly
bearing, his fine physique, clear voice and
strong face are accessories of no small value.</p>

<p>There is a field in which General Pershing
has been a pronounced success as a speaker
which perhaps is not commonly known, and
that is at dinners and similar public functions.
Anyone who notes the corners of Pershing's
mouth, at once is aware that the General possesses
a keen sense of humor. No better illustration
could be given of this fact than an incident<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
not long ago recorded in the <i>Missouri Historical
Review</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"He was invited to a stag dinner party one evening
where a jolly story-telling lot of good fellows
were to be present and he went primed with his best
stories, a memorandum in his vest pocket to aid him
in telling them. The memorandum was accidentally
dropped on the floor and was picked up by one of
his friends, who immediately saw what it was and
decided to have his little joke at the General's expense.
The finder got an opportunity to spring the
first story and promptly started off with the first
one on the list. Pershing said nothing and laughed&mdash;he
always does when a good story is told, and
makes you laugh, too&mdash;but when the second one on
his list was told he felt in his pocket for the memorandum
and discovered its loss. A few minutes later
the General, after a consultation with a waiter, announced
that he had just received a message which
would require his absence for a few minutes on important
business.</p>

<p>"Jumping into a car he was hurried to a hotel.
From the clerk he secured the names of half a dozen
traveling men&mdash;drummers&mdash;who were stopping there
and announced that he wanted to see these men at
once on important business. The drummers responded
and in twenty minutes the General was back
at the banquet, before the coffee had been poured,
with a new stock of yarns. Then ensued a battle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
royal between the two famous raconteurs, much to
the amusements of the guests, until his friend played
out the string and left the General victor in the
humorous contest.</p>

<p>"Just at this juncture one of the drummers, made
up as a police officer, arrived, arrested the joker,
searched him and found the General's memorandum,
which he exposed to the hilarious guests with the
significant comment: 'General Pershing has really
been the only entertainer this evening, but lots of
people are making reputations with the public on the
General's ideas.'"</p></div>

<p>His words to the British public and his public
address in France are alike notable for their
simplicity and directness, their friendliness and
dignity. He understands thoroughly his part.
It is a great advantage for America to have a
representative for whose public utterances no
apology must be made and no explanations
given.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Man Behind the General</span></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> would be as impertinent as it is impossible
for one who has not been associated with General
Pershing for a long time directly and
closely to attempt anything like an analysis of
the man or his career. There are, nevertheless,
certain qualities that have become more or less
the possessions of the public because they have
been manifested in his public service. It is
therefore permissible to refer briefly to certain
of them.</p>

<p>As a foundation for all his work is a strong,
vigorous body which at all times has been
cared for in a way to make it the servant and
not the master of the man. Regular and somewhat
strenuous physical exercise maintains the
uniformly excellent health and vigor of the
Commander. Naturally strong, hard work developed
his strength in his boyhood, and his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
military career has made many demands upon
as well as increased these powers. Even when
he entered West Point he was an acknowledged
expert in horsemanship and his early work in
the ten years of his campaigns against the
Indians, certainly tested his skill to the utmost
in this particular line.</p>

<p>He has known almost every form of active
service the American Army can provide. In the
demands for rough or heavy work excellent
judges asserted when he was sent to France
that he has no superior and since his arrival
he has shown that he was equally at home in
the finer and higher demands that were made
upon him. His distinguished bearing, his
physical vigor and good health have provided
an excellent foundation. The old Latin proverb
<i>Mens sana in corpore sano</i> has certainly been
verified in the life of General Pershing.</p>

<p>It was Oliver Wendell Holmes who has been
frequently quoted as having said that "the
foremost qualification for success is the proper
selection of one's grandparents." The forcefulness
of General Pershing's father, the inspiring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
words of his mother form a rare background.
"Foremost citizen," "devoted to his
family," "sterling," "ambitious"&mdash;these are
some of the words of old-time friends and
neighbors, descriptive and expressive of their
estimates of his father. All of them, however,
are not more suggestive and tender than a
neighbor's description of the General's mother
as a "splendid homemaker," and "an inspiration
to her children." There are many things
a son cherishes more highly than the inheritance
of great riches, and foremost is the heritage
of a good name.</p>

<p>As the oldest of nine children naturally he
learned and assumed certain responsibilities at
an early age. With the advice and help of his
mother it is said that even when he was only
fourteen he was managing a farm in the absence
of his father. There was work to be done and
in abundance. There is ancient authority for
the claim that it is good to "learn to bear the
yoke in one's youth." A "yoke," however, is
not the burden, it is a contrivance which enables
one to bear his burden.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>A prominent and successful man of business
in New York City declared not long ago that if
a man does not learn to work when he is young
(this man placed the limit at twenty-two) he
does not learn afterward. This was the result
of both observation and experience.</p>

<p>Whether or not these conclusions are correct,
certain it is that in the case of General Pershing,
as it has been also in many other marked
instances, he learned not only to work but also
learned how to work when he was only a boy.</p>

<p>His birthplace was in the great state of Missouri.
Reference has already been made to the
semi-slang expression which indicates that a
man from that State "must be shown." Not
long ago there appeared in one of the foremost
newspapers of America a bit of verse applying
this saying to the present gigantic task of
the Commander of the American Expeditionary
Forces in France. The following quotation
(<i>The Evening Telegram</i>), whatever it may lack
in poetic flavor, is expressive of the public conception
of the meaning of the statement:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<div class='poem'>
"When 'Jack' Pershing left for Europe<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With his sturdy fighting men,</span><br />
Kaiser Willy said, 'How silly!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I'll annihilate them when</span><br />
I have time to bother with 'em,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For that peewee Yankee force</span><br />
Won't be in it for a minute<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With my Prussian troops, of course.'"</span><br />
<br />
"Is that so? Well, Kaiser Willy<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You have made a foolish bet,</span><br />
You have boasted, then you've roasted,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But you haven't whipped 'em yet.</span><br />
Let this, Kaiser, make you wiser,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If you really care to know,</span><br />
Jack was born in old Missouri,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He's a man you'll 'have to show.'"</span><br />
<br />
"Pershing, Pershing, 'Black Jack' Pershing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We are with you, one and all,</span><br />
We will ever pull the lever<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That will make the Prussians fall.</span><br />
Fighting Pershing,&mdash;yes, we know you,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Old Missouri born and bred,</span><br />
Here's our motto, we will show you,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'All together! Forge ahead!'"</span><br />
</div>

<p>His determination is one of his fundamental
qualities. It is seen in the very expression of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
his face, emphasized by the prominent nose and
jaw. Although it was doubtless a heritage,
nevertheless the trying experiences of his early
days intensified and aided in developing the
quality.</p>

<p>He knew the meaning of hard work when he
was a boy, as has been said, but it did not shake
his ultimate purpose. He was eager to obtain
an education and with this determination once
fixed in his mind he never relaxed. Working,
teaching, saving, when he entered the Kirksville
Normal School he understood something
of the price he was paying for the advantages
he received. He knew what the attendance had
cost him and it is easily understood why he was
determined to get the worth of his money.</p>

<p>At West Point this same element was still
prominent. It impressed his classmates and
teachers. He saw what he wanted and wasted
no time or effort on "asides" that might interfere.
To be senior captain of cadets was to
him the supreme honor&mdash;therefore it was only
natural that he won the appointment.</p>

<p>The same spirit carried him through his campaign<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
in the Philippine Islands. The Moros
could be brought to reason, therefore the Moros
were brought to reason. It animates him in
France&mdash;"Germany can be beaten," "Germany
must be beaten," and the third clause is as natural
as the words of the General can make them&mdash;"Germany
will be beaten." It is fitting that
the commander of the best trained army
America ever had should lead it in a spirit of
determination that cannot be shaken.</p>

<p>Underneath this firmness is an unfailing
spirit of fairness. After seven years of hard
work he established in the Philippines a new
record in diplomacy by winning the complete
confidence of the natives. Said one man, "In
all the Philippines there is no one so beloved
for his gentle yet unrelenting manner, his absolute
fairness and justice, as this soldier who
had the unusual power of instilling love for
himself and fear for his enmity at the same
time."</p>

<p>In his boyhood his close friends report that
this same quality often made him the protector
of the younger boys when they were the victims<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
of the school bully. "As a young fellow,"
states one of his early friends, "he was accommodating
and never pushed himself forward.
He was always ready to help other fellows who
were not able to work out their problems. As
a boy his decisions were always quick and accurate."</p>

<p>Of course the spirit of fairness implies the
possession of a kindly nature as well as imagination.
One cannot be fair or just to his enemies
unless he can first get their points of view.
This was the underlying quality in the work
Lincoln did. He saw what his opponents saw
but he also saw more. It is the quality which
makes of a man or a boy "a good sport." He
appreciates his antagonist and also&mdash;in the end&mdash;is
appreciated by his antagonist.</p>

<p>A writer in the <i>Missouri Historical Review</i>,
whose words have before been quoted, pays the
following tribute to this quality in General
Pershing:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>With his scholarly attainments, his ability as a
writer and speaker and his grasp of big problems,
Pershing might have developed into a statesman: he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
certainly would have succeeded as a business man
if he could have contented himself with the humdrum
life in a downtown office; and with his attractive
personality he might indeed have led a
successful career as a politician, except for his unfortunate
modesty which even in the army has frequently
delayed for him a merited promotion. As
a soldier, Pershing's methods are those of clemency
rather than ruthlessness and he makes personal
friends even of his enemies.</p></div>

<p>Writing as he did before the declaration of
war with Germany he adds:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Since the death of General Funston he has been
in command of the Department of the South, one
of the important military posts of the country at
the present time. With this country an active participant
in the War of the Nations and the probability
that a strong expeditionary force will be sent
to co&ouml;perate with the Allies in France, what is more
probable or desirable than that General Pershing
should command it? He has participated in every
war in which this country has been engaged for
thirty years and in every campaign has added luster
to his own name and distinction to American armies.</p></div>

<p>One has to read no more than the painstaking
reports which he sent from the Philippines<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
to the Adjutant General or to the Headquarters
Department of Mindanao and Jolo to comprehend
the mastery of details which has been a
striking characteristic of General Pershing.
From his recommendations concerning military
posts and the disposition of the troops in the
province he turns to deal specifically with detailed
suggestions about cold storage plants
and to present carefully prepared suggestions
to aid the quartermaster from whom "too much
is expected." It is easy for one to tell what
<i>ought</i> to be done. The world has never lacked,
nor does it lack now, multitudes of men who
fancy they are competent to do that. But to
find one who is able to tell how to do it&mdash;he
is the individual for whom the world ever has
a warm welcome. Many are officious, but only
a few are competent or efficient.</p>

<p>Nor is this quality of mind and heart limited
to details of administration alone. It applies
also to his knowledge of men. The incident of
the telegram to the former cook, John Kulolski,
related in Chapter XVI, is illustrative. Most
men find that for which they are looking. If<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
they expect to find evil they seldom are disappointed.
If their objective is the thing worth
while, that too they find. To know men as well
as maps, to study soldiers as well as supplies,
to grasp the varying and differing elements
that compose an army&mdash;these are the essential
elements in a successful leader of men. To the
German war lords their men may be merely
"cannon fodder." To the public a French soldier
may be a poilu, a British fighter a Tommy,
an American a doughboy. To General Pershing
every one that carries a gun is above all else
a man. This is at once the basis of his confidence
in and appeal to his followers. It may
be because of this trait that Rowland Thomas
and others have described General Pershing as
"the most brilliant and most dependable general
officer in our army."</p>

<p>Like many men who are large, physically as
well as mentally, he has almost infinite patience.
This quality too is so closely linked to
self-control that at times it is difficult to distinguish
between them. Confidence and self-possession
are the foundation stones upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
which patience rests. It is the man sure neither
of himself nor of the goal he seeks nor of the
cause for which he fights who becomes impatient.
Was promotion delayed? Then he must
wait with patience, first making himself fit to
be promoted or doing his work in a manner
that would compel recognition. Had the Moros
for three centuries successfully resisted every
attempt to subjugate them? Then his campaign
must be so conducted that the little
brown people must be made to see that the
United States was seeking to help as well as to
subdue. Had Germany for more than forty
years been preparing armies to overthrow civilization
and dominate the world? Then, "Germany
can be beaten, Germany must be beaten,
Germany will be beaten," is the quiet statement
of the American Commander, because,
having confidence in the cause for which he is
fighting and faith in his fighters, he can be
patient. With the end in view, there must be
no hasty or impatient activity which might
lead to disaster.</p>


<p>One distinguished writer on military topics<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
has called him the American Kitchener, because
of his ability as an organizer. Points of
resemblance there may be and doubtless are,
and these are not limited to any one man,
British or American, but the people of the
United States are well content to take him as
he is. If comparisons are to be made then the
resemblance should be based upon the fact that
the party to which reference is made is "like
Pershing," not because General Pershing is
like another.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i-290.jpg" width="500" height="348" alt="General Foch and General Pershing." title="" />
<span class="caption">General Foch and General Pershing.</span>
</div>

<p>It is a marvelous time in the history of the
world and the times require men equal to the
demand. Nearly four years of the war passed
and up to that time the hearts of many were
heavy because no one outstanding figure had
appeared. The unspoken call was for a leader.
Great men, good men and many of them were
in evidence, but the Napoleonic leader had not
appeared.</p>

<p>Then upon the insistence of the President of
the United States a supreme commander, one
brain, one heart, one sole power to direct, was
found and the Allies were no longer separate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
units, each free to come or go, without adhesion
or cohesion. There was now to be one plan
and one planner. The world already is aware
of the result, for Foch has been tried and tested.
The great unifying power has been discovered.
The man for whom the world had been waiting
had appeared and taken charge. Whether
times make men or men make the times is a
riddle as old as the one concerning the egg and
the hen as to which was first produced. Without
question both are true.</p>

<p>But no military genius can win battles, much
less win a war, unless he is supported by strong
men and true. And in the number of those who
are closest to Foch is the Commander of the
American Expeditionary Forces in France. All
are rejoiced that he is where he is, but they are
equally proud that he is what he is.</p>

<p>It is easy to paraphrase the words of the great
Apostle to the Gentiles, and to say of General
John Joseph Pershing that he too "is a citizen
of no mean country." It is also easy to say
that he is no mean citizen of that country, for
he is both the citizen and the general, the man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
as well as the soldier. And there is the strongest
possible desire on the part of his countrymen,
that, upheld by his armies and helped by
everyone in his native land, he may speedily
add new luster to his name and to that of his
own land until the words of the greatest orator
of the new world may have an added significance
and a deeper meaning&mdash;"I&mdash;I also&mdash;am
an American!"</p>
